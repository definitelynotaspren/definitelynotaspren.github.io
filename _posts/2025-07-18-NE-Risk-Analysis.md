## 2. Narrative Analysis of Key Sites and Operations

### New Jersey: Quiet Reactivations Under New Names and Contracts

**Elizabeth Detention Center (Elizabeth, NJ):** This long-standing ICE facility – privately run by CoreCivic – was slated for closure under a 2021 New Jersey law banning ICE detention contracts. However, in August 2023 a federal judge struck down that state ban as unconstitutional, effectively **paving the way for Elizabeth to stay open**[politico.com](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/29/new-jersey-law-immigrant-detention-contracts-unconstitutional-00113398#:~:text=A%20federal%20judge%20on%20Tuesday,state%E2%80%99s%20last%20detention%20center%20open). ICE signaled it _“fully intend[ed]”_ to extend CoreCivic’s contract, which was due to expire at that time[politico.com](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/29/new-jersey-law-immigrant-detention-contracts-unconstitutional-00113398#:~:text=The%20opinion%20by%20U,extend%20the%20private%20detention%20contract). Indeed, the extension went through: Elizabeth remains operational into 2025, continuing to hold roughly a few hundred immigration detainees. This **defiance of NJ’s ban** came with federal backing – Biden administration lawyers had argued closing Elizabeth would be “catastrophic” for immigration enforcement in the region[politico.com](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/29/new-jersey-law-immigrant-detention-contracts-unconstitutional-00113398#:~:text=Attorneys%20for%20the%20Biden%20administration,further%20from%20their%20families%2C%20officials).

 

Local advocates report that the Elizabeth center still suffers from **inhumane conditions** – a reputation earned over decades of complaints and lawsuits[politico.com](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/29/new-jersey-law-immigrant-detention-contracts-unconstitutional-00113398#:~:text=All%20but%20one%20member%20of,is%20against%20holding%20immigrants%20there). In early 2025, three NJ members of Congress (Reps. Menendez, Watson Coleman, McIver) attempted a surprise inspection of Elizabeth amid rumors of deteriorating conditions. Initially, ICE **denied them entry** (echoing a pattern of opacity), relenting only after pressure[newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/immigration/newark-congressmembers-object-to-reopening-of-local-immigrant-detention-facility/#:~:text=Menendez%2C%20McIver%2C%20and%20fellow%20Rep,before%20eventually%20being%20allowed%20inside). The visit underscored a _“lack of transparency”_ at privately-run sites. Advocates are also watching for any **name-change or rebranding** by CoreCivic. Given NJ’s law (still under appeal) forbids new detention contracts, one red flag is whether CoreCivic might attempt to operate under a subsidiary or alternate name to continue business as usual. So far, Elizabeth’s operations have continued under the same banner, but any corporate sleight-of-hand would likely be noticed by the active immigrant rights community in NJ.

 

**Delaney Hall – Newark, NJ:** A **major new development** is the reopening of Delaney Hall in Newark’s East Ward as an ICE detention center. This facility, owned by GEO Group, had previously held immigration detainees (2011–2017) under contract with Essex County. In 2021, New Jersey’s ICE ban forced Essex to end that arrangement. But after the ban’s partial nullification, GEO Group moved swiftly to **reactivate Delaney Hall** – this time via a direct 15-year contract with ICE worth ~$60 million per year[newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/immigration/ice-opens-newark-detention-center-amid-lawsuit-over-permits-inspections/#:~:text=ICE%20signed%20a%2015,Trump%E2%80%99s%20promises%20of%20mass%20deportations). ICE announced in Feb 2025 that the 1,000-bed center would **“imminently” reopen for undocumented immigrants**, making it _“the first [new] detention center to open under the second Trump administration”_ and **“by far the largest”** ICE facility in the NY/NJ area[newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/immigration/newark-congressmembers-object-to-reopening-of-local-immigrant-detention-facility/#:~:text=News%20that%20Immigration%20and%20Customs,Newark). By May 2025, detainees were already being housed there (ICE quietly moved people in on May 1)[newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/immigration/ice-opens-newark-detention-center-amid-lawsuit-over-permits-inspections/#:~:text=Federal%20immigration%20officials%20have%20started,according%20to%20a%20government%20spokesperson).

 

What’s striking is how **“quiet” this buildup was** – executed _despite_ fierce local opposition and without city approvals. Newark officials say GEO Group **never obtained proper city permits** to operate a detention center[newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/immigration/ice-opens-newark-detention-center-amid-lawsuit-over-permits-inspections/#:~:text=The%20quick%20opening%20of%20Delaney,permits%20to%20operate%20Delaney%20Hall). In fact, when city inspectors first came knocking, **Delaney Hall staff turned them away**. Once inspections did occur (under court order), dozens of safety violations were found (faulty plumbing, fire code issues, etc.)[newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/immigration/ice-opens-newark-detention-center-amid-lawsuit-over-permits-inspections/#:~:text=scheduled%20inspections%20a%20couple%20of,had%20received%20the%20inspection%20report). A core dispute is whether the facility’s use changed enough to need a new Certificate of Occupancy (CO). Newark argues yes – GEO **changed the tenant/use** by shifting from a county-run reentry center to a federal immigrant jail – but GEO claims it’s the same building use as before, thus no new CO needed[newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/immigration/ice-opens-newark-detention-center-amid-lawsuit-over-permits-inspections/#:~:text=for%20GEO%20Group%20told%20the,had%20received%20the%20inspection%20report). This technical fight has big implications: Newark’s Mayor Ras Baraka (now a gubernatorial candidate) vowed to use _“all [his] power to keep Delaney Hall from opening,”_ and the city filed suit to halt operations[newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/immigration/ice-opens-newark-detention-center-amid-lawsuit-over-permits-inspections/#:~:text=Newark%20Mayor%20Ras%20Baraka%2C%20a,undocumented%20immigrants%20in%20the%20process). The Trump administration’s DOJ intervened on GEO’s side, urging the judge to dismiss Newark’s _“aggressive”_ lawsuit[newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/immigration/ice-opens-newark-detention-center-amid-lawsuit-over-permits-inspections/#:~:text=The%20Trump%20administration%20has%20also,%E2%80%9Caggressive%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Clegally%20unjustified%E2%80%9D%20lawsuit).

 

**Public messaging vs. reality:** Federal and local officials are talking past each other here. ICE justified Delaney Hall’s quick opening as necessary to ramp up deportations promised by President Trump[newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/immigration/ice-opens-newark-detention-center-amid-lawsuit-over-permits-inspections/#:~:text=company%20that%20owns%20the%20detention,Trump%E2%80%99s%20promises%20of%20mass%20deportations). They did so with minimal public notice – advocates only learned of the contract after it was signed. Locally, officials couch their resistance in terms of _“will of the people”_ and public safety. Newark’s two House representatives blasted the plan as an insult to constituents and a return to _“inhumane”_ policies[newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/immigration/newark-congressmembers-object-to-reopening-of-local-immigrant-detention-facility/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Delaney%20Hall%20contract%20is,%E2%80%9D)[newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/immigration/newark-congressmembers-object-to-reopening-of-local-immigrant-detention-facility/#:~:text=immigrants%2C%20and%20I%20will%20not,%E2%80%9D). While ICE frames Delaney Hall as just a “temporary shelter” or “processing center” in some statements, the scale (1000 beds) and the involvement of a notorious private prison company make its true purpose clear. **Red flags** include the **speed and secrecy** of its activation and the attempt to avoid municipal oversight. The fight over Delaney Hall is ongoing in court, and it epitomizes the “pre-activation” pattern: federal agencies and contractors moving under the radar to establish capacity, then presenting it as a _fait accompli_.

 

**Other NJ Sites:** New Jersey had previously emptied all county jails holding ICE detainees (Hudson, Bergen, and Essex Counties ended their contracts by 2021). As of mid-2025, we found **no evidence those county jails have resumed ICE intakes** – likely thanks to continued local political opposition. However, advocates remain vigilant. For instance, the Hudson County Correctional Facility in Kearny (a large jail once heavily used by ICE) sits only partially utilized after losing ICE revenue. Were county leadership to quietly seek new funds, **ICE or its contractors could dangle “emergency housing” agreements** to use a portion of the jail again. Any such move would probably be couched as a _“federal partnership to alleviate migrant influx”_ rather than an ICE deal – exactly the kind of vague language that masks detention. We did not find open-source confirmation of this happening yet. The same goes for Bergen County Jail. Both facilities would require public Freeholder or Commissioner approval to restart ICE detention – a high-profile step – so a covert restart would be difficult to hide. More likely are **federal end-runs**: e.g. leasing private warehouses or state-owned land. One rumor (per local politicians) is that **Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst** (a military base in NJ) could be tapped for immigration detention or deportation processing[newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/immigration/newark-congressmembers-object-to-reopening-of-local-immigrant-detention-facility/#:~:text=were%20initially%20denied%20access%20before,eventually%20being%20allowed%20inside). That would fall under DOD/FEMA authority rather than a local contract, thus evading the NJ ban entirely. Governor Murphy and others were caught off-guard by that report, illustrating how such plans can emerge with minimal state input[newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/immigration/newark-congressmembers-object-to-reopening-of-local-immigrant-detention-facility/#:~:text=And%20further%20south%2C%20the%20Trump,he%E2%80%99s%20not%20opposed%20to%20it). Since our focus is on non-military contractors, we note this base idea only as context – the **general trend is federal actors exploiting any jurisdictional grey area (federal land, private contracts, etc.) to expand detention capacity in NJ** despite state-level prohibitions.

### Pennsylvania and Philadelphia Region: Former Facilities and New Indirect Tactics

**York County Prison (York, PA):** For nearly 30 years, York County Prison was one of ICE’s largest detention sites in the Northeast, until it **ended its contract in August 2021**. At that time, detainee numbers had plummeted (from ~700 down to ~300) and the county balked at costly upgrades ICE was requiring[norrismclaughlin.com](https://norrismclaughlin.com/ib/deportation/york-county-prison-pennsylvania-immigrant-detention/#:~:text=York%20County%20Detention%20Centers%20Closed). York’s local officials cited budget concerns and shifting federal policy in their decision. The attached **immigration court in York also closed in 2021** once detainees were gone[norrismclaughlin.com](https://norrismclaughlin.com/ib/deportation/york-county-prison-pennsylvania-immigrant-detention/#:~:text=York%20Immigration%20Court%20Closure). Since then, York’s large facility (which had an entire dedicated ICE wing and courtroom) has not publicly re-engaged with ICE. Our research did not find any new contracts or construction permits suggesting a reactivation. However, York bears watching: it has ready-made capacity and _institutional knowledge_ of ICE operations. A quiet arrangement could, in theory, be made to house detainees again, potentially under the guise of _“intergovernmental service”_ for federal marshals or a “correctional partnership.” **No such deal has surfaced yet**, and notably, Pennsylvania’s political climate has shifted (York’s community and state reps have been less keen on ICE since the 2021 closure). We rate current ICE activity at York as _dormant_ but acknowledge it remains a prime target should ICE seek rapid expansion.

 

**Berks County Residential Center (Leesport, PA):** This facility is a rare success story for detention abolitionists – and a case study in repurposing (and re-repurposing) under public scrutiny. Berks operated from 2001–2021 as an ICE **family detention center**, housing immigrant parents with children. After years of documented abuse and a sustained **“Shut Down Berks” campaign**, it was emptied of families in early 2021[phillyvoice.com](https://www.phillyvoice.com/immigrant-detention-berks-county-residential-center-women-asylum-ice/#:~:text=A%20Berks%20County%20detention%20center,only%20facility)[americanimmigrationcouncil.org](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/berks-detention-center-closes-more-work/#:~:text=After%20years%20of%20advocacy%20and,Berks%20Coalition%20celebrated%20the%20news). But rather than close it, ICE (under the Biden administration) **struck a new deal to reopen Berks in early 2022 as a women-only asylum seeker detention site**. This was done with minimal fanfare – Berks County quietly approved an amended contract in Sept 2021 to change the facility’s purpose[phillyvoice.com](https://www.phillyvoice.com/immigrant-detention-berks-county-residential-center-women-asylum-ice/#:~:text=rights.). The public explanation was that it would be a _“residential center”_ for adult women, framed almost as a humanitarian shelter. In reality it remained a secure detention center, and by Feb 2022 it was holding dozens of women who had recently crossed the border[phillyvoice.com](https://www.phillyvoice.com/immigrant-detention-berks-county-residential-center-women-asylum-ice/#:~:text=,People%27s%20Justice%20Center%2C%20told%20WITF). Outcry resumed immediately. By late 2022, pressure from Pennsylvania officials and advocates (including a 50-lawmaker letter) mounted on ICE to exit Berks[phillyvoice.com](https://www.phillyvoice.com/immigrant-detention-berks-county-residential-center-women-asylum-ice/#:~:text=center%20and%20increase%20its%20bed,space)[phillyvoice.com](https://www.phillyvoice.com/immigrant-detention-berks-county-residential-center-women-asylum-ice/#:~:text=In%20September%2C%20the%20Berks%20County,in%20opposition%20to%20the%20plan). The breakthrough came at the end of 2022: **DHS announced it would finally terminate the Berks contract effective Jan 31, 2023**, and all remaining detainees were released by mid-January[wearecasa.org](https://wearecasa.org/berks-county-detention-center-closes-finalizing-eight-year-campaign-led-by-pa-immigrant-community/#:~:text=,the%20end%20of%20November%2C%202022)[americanimmigrationcouncil.org](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/berks-detention-center-closes-more-work/#:~:text=After%20years%20of%20advocacy%20and,Berks%20Coalition%20celebrated%20the%20news). As of mid-2025, Berks is **closed for good as an ICE site**. The county has explored alternative uses (some floated ideas include treatment center or other county services), but any reuse would require state licensing. Advocates remain on alert for any attempt to slip immigration detention back in – for example, via a **“reprogramming” of the site for FEMA or DOJ uses** that could later involve ICE. No such plans have been disclosed, and given Berks’ notoriety, it’s unlikely ICE would try to sneak back in there in the near term. The Berks saga shows how public resistance and transparency (e.g. public meetings, local news) can thwart quiet federal plans – it is the opposite of a “stealth” success for ICE.

 

**Philadelphia & Surroundings:** Philadelphia itself has no dedicated ICE jail (and city officials have reaffirmed its _“sanctuary city”_ policies). However, the region’s enforcement pipeline still exists, just more diffused. Under the Trump administration’s new push, Philly advocates noted a rise in **ICE raids and courthouse arrests** in the city. For example, after a wave of ICE actions in early 2025, Philadelphia’s mayor and council publicly condemned the “anti-immigrant efforts”[phillyvoice.com](https://www.phillyvoice.com/tags/immigrants/#:~:text=After%20ICE%20raids%20this%20week%2C,immigration%20efforts). But beyond statements, the city’s ability to intervene is limited if ICE acts on federal property or via sub-federal actors.

 

Southeastern PA had other ICE facilities historically – notably **Pike County Correctional Facility** and **Clinton County Correctional** (both county jails that took ICE detainees). In 2021, Pike County (in NE PA) also ended its ICE contract, reportedly releasing detainees rather than transferring them[norrismclaughlin.com](https://norrismclaughlin.com/ib/deportation/york-county-prison-pennsylvania-immigrant-detention/#:~:text=Around%20four%20months%20ago%2C%20Pike,103%20and%20the%20county%E2%80%99s%20officials). That left a gap which ICE filled by increasing use of the **Clinton County Correctional Facility** (a more remote jail in central PA) and the **Moshannon Valley Correctional Center** (a formerly closed private prison that ICE reactivated in late 2021 under GEO Group management). These are outside our core geographic focus, but it’s worth noting that the **“shell game”** of moving detainees to more hidden locations was already underway in 2022-2023. By shifting detainees to out-of-sight facilities (Moshannon is hours from any major city), ICE can avoid local backlash. We did not uncover new capacity-building in Philadelphia per se – instead, ICE transports Philly-area arrestees to where bed space exists (now possibly Delaney Hall in NJ, or far-flung jails). This creates a **courthouse-to-out-of-county pipeline**: an individual might be detained at a Philly immigration court appearance and by evening be in a van or plane to, say, central Pennsylvania or even Mississippi. Such transfers are hard to track; attorneys often learn only after the fact, which raises due process concerns.

 

A note on **Lackawanna County (Scranton area)**: This was mentioned in the brief due to its courthouse and jail. We found no evidence of a large ICE operation there currently. The Lackawanna County Jail does hold ICE detainees occasionally (as many county jails do on a short-term basis when someone is picked up locally). But no retrofitting or contract expansion was evident. The focus in Pennsylvania remains on formerly-used dedicated sites like York and Berks, and on monitoring any **irregular contractor activity** (e.g. a sudden hiring spree by a prison vendor in a county that quit ICE would raise alarms). So far, Pennsylvania has seen more **closures** than openings of ICE detention under Biden – the question now is whether Trump-era policy will reverse that quietly. The early signs (e.g. no move yet to re-open York or Berks) suggest ICE is still relying on Pennsylvania’s more out-of-the-way prisons rather than politically sensitive ones.

### New York State: Expanding the Patchwork – Upstate, Hudson Valley, and NYC

**Western New York (Buffalo/Batavia/Niagara Region):** In response to surging enforcement, ICE has rapidly **expanded its detention footprint around Buffalo** – not by building new centers, but by creatively using a patchwork of existing facilities. The sole dedicated ICE detention center in the region is the **Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia** (a 650-bed center operated by Akima Global Services under ICE contract)[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/02/20/521935/#:~:text=Akima%20Global%20Services%2C%20the%20contractor,filings%2C%20have%20denied%20any%20wrongdoing). Batavia has been **near capacity** in 2023–2024 and has a critical limitation: it **cannot hold women or children** (it’s an all-male adult facility)[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=center%20in%20Batavia). Thus, as ICE apprehensions spiked in 2025 (driven in part by a White House quota of 3,000 arrests per day[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=The%20increased%20number%20of%20locations,3%2C000%20immigration%20arrests%20per%20day)), the agency quietly **activated at least five alternate holding locations** in Western NY:

- **Tonawanda Border Patrol Station (Erie County):** A CBP station in a suburban office park (600 Colvin Woods Pkwy) suddenly began holding migrants for days at a time. In June 2025, 23 immigrants were **detained for ~10 days** at this site – essentially an office lockup not designed for long stays[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=In%20the%20Town%20of%20Tonawanda%2C%C2%A0,near%20the%20Colvin%20Boulevard%20exit). This station is just off I-290, a logistics plus for quiet transfers. It’s unusual because normally Border Patrol would transfer arrestees to ICE within hours; now they’re holding people there due to “space constraints” elsewhere[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=In%20the%20past%2C%20Customs%20may,are%20lasting%20days%20and%20weeks). The **amenities are sparse**: CBP stations have holding cells meant for short detention (no proper beds or showers). Detainees at Tonawanda got _microwaved burritos and camping-style shower bags_ in some instances[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=One%20family%20that%20was%20held,were%20not%20available%20to%20them)[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=were%20fed%20microwaved%20meals%20and,were%20not%20available%20to%20them), prompting serious concerns from advocates about health and sanitation. Officials euphemistically call these _“temporary holding facilities”_ but acknowledge they’re being used beyond the 72-hour limit normally allowed[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=constraints%20at%20other%20locations)[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=Under%20Customs%20policy%2C%20detentions%20by,term%20federal%20detention%20facility%20availability.%E2%80%9D).
    
- **Peace Bridge and Rainbow Bridge Ports of Entry:** At Buffalo’s Peace Bridge and Niagara Falls’ Rainbow Bridge (both international crossings), CBP has holding areas. Reports indicate **families and individuals have been kept for _weeks_ in these port facilities** in 2025[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=And%20in%20Buffalo%20and%20Niagara,advocates%20interviewed%20by%20Investigative%20Post)[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=In%20the%20past%2C%20Customs%20may,are%20lasting%20days%20and%20weeks). These are even less equipped for long stays – essentially back-office rooms. One family held at the Rainbow Bridge described being fed only microwave meals and having no real showers (just makeshift accommodations)[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=One%20family%20that%20was%20held,were%20not%20available%20to%20them). The **public barely knows** this is happening unless advocates speak out, since CBP doesn’t announce it. Even the local bridge authority CEO only learned that Peace Bridge was hosting detainees because of “space constraints” elsewhere[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=Ron%20Rienas%2C%20CEO%20of%20Buffalo,%E2%80%9D). This indicates a high level of **coordination between ICE and CBP** behind the scenes to use every nook and cranny as overflow.
    
- **Niagara County Jail (Lockport, NY):** The sheriff of Niagara County confirmed in June 2025 that his jail **signed an agreement with ICE in early May** and had begun housing immigration detainees[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=Filicetti%2C%20the%20Niagara%20County%20sheriff,same%20standards%20as%20other%20inmates). At least two women were being held there as of that report[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=In%20Lockport%2C%20the%20Niagara%20County,Niagara%20County%20Sheriff%20Michael%20Filicetti). This is significant because Niagara had not been a known ICE detention site previously. The sheriff openly cited financial reasons: ICE pays about **$148 per detainee per day**, a lucrative deal for a county jail[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=Filicetti%2C%20the%20Niagara%20County%20sheriff,same%20standards%20as%20other%20inmates). The contract was executed with little public debate (Niagara County’s legislature is Republican-controlled and apparently amenable to assisting ICE). The arrangement was likely packaged as an _“Inter-Governmental Service Agreement (IGSA)”_ which often flies under the radar – those agreements can be made by a sheriff or county executive and only later come to light. **Red flag:** In Niagara’s inmate locator, detainees appear listed under “federal hold” or similar, giving minimal info. Lawyers reported difficulty even knowing who is where, as ICE does not proactively publish that they’ve started using X jail.
    
- **Allegany County Jail (Belmont, NY):** A smaller rural jail that, according to ICE data, had 3 detainees recently[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=The%20county%20jail%20in%20Allegany,presently%20three%2C%20ICE%20data%20shows). This suggests ICE is **scattering detainees to very small facilities** as well – possibly a result of no single large site for women in upstate NY after the closure of the ICE contract at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility’s women’s annex years ago. (Batavia has no annex for women; previously, ICE sent women to county jails like Clinton or out-of-region.) Allegany County is quite remote, indicating these detainees might have been picked up near the northern border or transferred from elsewhere and placed there quietly. The local impact is low-profile given the small numbers, but it complicates access to counsel.
    

All these developments happened with **minimal public announcements**. We only know about them thanks to investigative journalism and local advocates. The pattern in Western NY is a **fragmentation of detention across multiple sites** – which makes oversight harder. Each site is run by different authorities (CBP, county sheriffs, ICE’s contractor at Batavia), and detainees can be shuffled between them. For example, a person might be held 5 days at the bridge, then sent to Batavia when a bed frees up, or vice versa. This piecemeal expansion is a hallmark of an early-stage “activation” of a wider detention regime. It avoids the splashy headline of “New 500-bed facility opening” by instead using 20 beds here, 50 there. But collectively, it significantly **boosts capacity in the region**. A concerning sign is the **lack of basic standards** – CBP holding cells with no showers are being used well beyond legal limits[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=Under%20Customs%20policy%2C%20detentions%20by,term%20federal%20detention%20facility%20availability.%E2%80%9D), raising humanitarian and legal issues (72-hour rule being ignored “based on long-term facility availability”[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/06/13/feds-adding-migrant-detention-centers-in-buffalo-area/#:~:text=constraints%20at%20other%20locations)). Whistleblowers here have mainly been attorneys and detainees themselves, reporting poor conditions. We have not seen internal memos, but a spike in civil rights complaints is likely if this continues.

 

**Hudson Valley (Orange County, NY):** Downstate in the Hudson Valley, **Orange County Jail** has re-emerged as a key ICE holding site – albeit in a quiet way. Orange County had a contract with ICE for years but in mid-2022 it seemed to be winding down (ICE suddenly transferred dozens of immigrants out of Orange County Jail with no notice, sending them as far as Mississippi[citylimits.org](https://citylimits.org/tag/orange-county-jail/#:~:text=,From%20NY%20Jail%20Without%20Notice)). This happened as New York City ended cooperation and pressure mounted on upstate facilities. However, by 2023, it was clear that ICE _never fully left_ Orange County. Approximately **55 detainees remained in the “ICE wing” of the jail as of April 2023[citylimits.org](https://citylimits.org/hunger-striking-ice-detainees-sue-over-conditions-at-nys-orange-county-jail/#:~:text=According%20to%20ICE%E2%80%99s%20detention%20management,%E2%80%9D)**, and those individuals spoke out about conditions. In fact, a group of them had led a hunger strike in 2022 to protest mistreatment and lack of services. According to a lawsuit filed on their behalf, the **Orange County Sheriff’s staff retaliated** harshly – including placing leaders in solitary confinement and other punitive measures[citylimits.org](https://citylimits.org/hunger-striking-ice-detainees-sue-over-conditions-at-nys-orange-county-jail/#:~:text=On%20Tuesday%20morning%2C%20three%20legal,a%20hunger%20strike%20last%20year). The detainees in Orange are civil immigration detainees, yet **they report being treated “the same way as criminals”**, confined under jail routines identical to the general inmate population[citylimits.org](https://citylimits.org/hunger-striking-ice-detainees-sue-over-conditions-at-nys-orange-county-jail/#:~:text=According%20to%20ICE%E2%80%99s%20detention%20management,%E2%80%9D). One reason: Orange is **only dedicating one jail wing to ICE**, so the detainees are effectively inmates in a jail setting.

 

The **public narrative** around Orange County is minimal. County officials did not publicly announce “renewing” the ICE arrangement – it just quietly persisted. It appears ICE has an active IGSA with Orange that was never terminated, allowing them to flow detainees in as needed. Community oversight is largely coming via NGOs like the New York Civil Liberties Union and Bronx Defenders, who are involved in the lawsuit. They claim that Orange’s conditions (e.g. food quality, medical care, excessive use of lockdown) violate detention standards. We also note a **“courthouse-to-jail pipeline”** in this area: ICE’s New York City field office has been known to transfer people arrested at NYC courts up to Orange County Jail for detention (since NYC itself has no ICE jail). For instance, a person detained by ICE in Brooklyn or Queens might be driven 60 miles north to Goshen, NY (where the Orange jail is) by the same evening. To the public, this is invisible unless the person has community support that tracks them. There is virtually **no media presence at Orange County Legislature meetings** about ICE now (compared to the past, when such contracts drew protests). This could be due to local political alignment – Orange County’s leadership may be quietly amenable to ICE’s needs in exchange for federal dollars, and with less activist attention than metro areas, it flies under the radar.

 

**New York City: Courthouse Holding & Federal Jail Conversions**

 

In New York City, ICE detention was largely pushed out in the late 2010s (the infamous Varick Street processing center in Manhattan closed in 2019 amid protests). By 2021–22, ICE relied on New Jersey and upstate jails for any NYC-area detainees. But now in 2025, with NJ facilities in flux and upstate ones full, ICE has resorted to **two troubling practices in NYC**:

- **Using 26 Federal Plaza (Manhattan) as a clandestine lockup:** 26 Federal Plaza is an office building in Lower Manhattan that houses immigration courts and ICE’s field office. Technically, it has holding cells for short stays (a day or so) when ICE arrests someone in the building. However, it’s now emerged that ICE has been keeping immigrants **overnight and for multiple nights on the 10th floor of this federal building**, well beyond normal procedure[thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/18/ice-nadler-goldman-federal-detention-manhattan/#:~:text=deputy%20director%20of%20the%20New,than%20benches%20or%20the%20floor)[thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/18/ice-nadler-goldman-federal-detention-manhattan/#:~:text=court%20following%20routine%20proceedings%20,the%20hours%20after%20their%20arrest). According to two Congressmen (Rep. Dan Goldman and Rep. Jerry Nadler) who tried to inspect it, detainees there have **“no beds”** – they literally sleep on benches or the floor of what amounts to an office holding area[thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/18/ice-nadler-goldman-federal-detention-manhattan/#:~:text=Spokespeople%20for%20ICE%20and%20the,respond%20to%20requests%20for%20comment)[thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/18/ice-nadler-goldman-federal-detention-manhattan/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20do%20not%20have%20beds%2C%E2%80%9D,Joyce%20said). When pressed, ICE’s local deputy director claimed these individuals are **“in transit”** and not in official detention, suggesting that ICE is exploiting a legal loophole: if they call it _processing_ rather than _detention_, perhaps they think Congress’s access rights and detention standards don’t apply[thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/18/ice-nadler-goldman-federal-detention-manhattan/#:~:text=Two%20members%20of%20Congress%20were,unannounced%20visits%20for%20oversight%20purposes)[thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/18/ice-nadler-goldman-federal-detention-manhattan/#:~:text=Spokespeople%20for%20ICE%20and%20the,respond%20to%20requests%20for%20comment). Goldman and Nadler (as well as Reps. Velázquez and Espaillat earlier) were **denied entry** to this facility in June 2025, which is a direct violation of a law allowing members of Congress to conduct surprise visits to detention sites[thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/18/ice-nadler-goldman-federal-detention-manhattan/#:~:text=Two%20members%20of%20Congress%20were,unannounced%20visits%20for%20oversight%20purposes)[thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/18/ice-nadler-goldman-federal-detention-manhattan/#:~:text=In%20the%20back,the%20hours%20after%20their%20arrest). ICE’s justification was essentially that this isn’t a “detention facility” at all. Yet people _have spent the night_ there, as ICE admitted on the record[thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/18/ice-nadler-goldman-federal-detention-manhattan/#:~:text=court%20following%20routine%20proceedings%20,the%20hours%20after%20their%20arrest)[thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/18/ice-nadler-goldman-federal-detention-manhattan/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20do%20not%20have%20beds%2C%E2%80%9D,Joyce%20said). Some of these individuals were reportedly **arrested by ICE agents (sometimes in plainclothes and even masked) immediately after their immigration court hearings** in the same building[thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/18/ice-nadler-goldman-federal-detention-manhattan/#:~:text=In%20the%20back,the%20hours%20after%20their%20arrest). This tactic – waiting in courthouse hallways to nab noncitizens who showed up for scheduled appointments – is _highly controversial_. It undermines trust in the legal process and, in effect, **turns a public courthouse into a trap**. Once arrested, they are taken upstairs and held on-site until ICE can transfer them to an out-of-city jail (often Orange County or Bergen County previously, now perhaps Delaney Hall or elsewhere). The **“short-term” holding has stretched into overnight stays** because ICE has limited beds available to send them to. This is precisely an _early-stage detention workaround_: ICE didn’t build a new jail in NYC (which would draw massive outcry); instead it repurposed office space and tries to legalistically claim it’s not a jail. The conditions – no beds, no outdoor access, likely no proper showers – are not compliant with ICE’s own detention standards, yet the practice continues in a gray zone. This scenario was exposed by the Congressmen and reported in THE CITY news[thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/18/ice-nadler-goldman-federal-detention-manhattan/#:~:text=deputy%20director%20of%20the%20New,than%20benches%20or%20the%20floor)[thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/18/ice-nadler-goldman-federal-detention-manhattan/#:~:text=court%20following%20routine%20proceedings%20,the%20hours%20after%20their%20arrest), making it harder for ICE to maintain total secrecy. But ICE has doubled down, still blocking oversight. That raises concerns of **detainee treatment (e.g. lack of medical staff on-site at night)** and the risk of rights violations (no attorney access while hidden on the 10th floor).
    
- **Transferring ICE detainees into the Brooklyn MDC:** The Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn is a federal jail run by the Bureau of Prisons for pretrial inmates (under DOJ). It has a notorious history – from chronic staff corruption to power outages leaving inmates in the cold. In mid-2025, it came to light that **ICE and BOP struck an arrangement to house immigration detainees at MDC**. Over 100 migrants arrested by ICE were sent to the Brooklyn jail, intermingled with the regular jail population[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/migrants-moved-to-brooklyn-jail/#:~:text=More%20than%20100%20migrants%20detained,142%20are%20being%20held). This is unusual because ICE typically avoids using BOP facilities (different jurisdiction and rules), but desperate times call for desperate measures. Representative Dan Goldman held a press conference outside MDC to decry this move, calling it _“dangerous, lawless, and unacceptable”_[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/migrants-moved-to-brooklyn-jail/#:~:text=There%20are%20concerns%20about%20the,Metropolitan%20Detention%20Center%20in%20Brooklyn). State Senator Andrew Gounardes noted that **“federal judges have called [MDC] barbaric”** in the past[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/migrants-moved-to-brooklyn-jail/#:~:text=transferring%20detainees%20to%20the%20MDC), alluding to its terrible conditions. The **Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed** that DHS (ICE) had begun transfers to MDC Brooklyn[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/migrants-moved-to-brooklyn-jail/#:~:text=Goldman%20has%20not%20been%20granted,transferring%20detainees%20to%20the%20MDC). Essentially, ICE has bought or negotiated bed space in a federal jail. The public explanation from ICE (via DHS statements) insists that all detainees are treated well and provided for – _“proper meals, medical treatment … opportunities to communicate,”_ etc.[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/migrants-moved-to-brooklyn-jail/#:~:text=The%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security,also%20responded%20with%20a%20statement) – but advocates and even some BOP staff have pushed back on those claims given MDC’s track record. This development is a **classic example of “masking under federal initiatives.”** ICE is not saying “we opened a new detention center”; they are likely categorizing this as _“using available Department of Justice housing for short-term holds”_. To the average person, it sounds like bureaucratic reshuffling, but in practice it means immigrants seeking asylum or caught in ICE dragnets are now locked in a **criminal jail**, subject to all the same harsh conditions, even though they face civil, not criminal, proceedings. Moreover, attorneys have trouble accessing clients in MDC due to stricter inmate protocols (different from ICE facility visitation). The use of MDC also bypasses any local input – NYC government has no say in who is held at a federal jail.
    

Taken together, the NYC maneuvers show ICE improvising with federal resources in lieu of dedicated space. It’s telling that **members of Congress have had to bird-dog these issues** – their involvement indicates just how under-the-radar ICE intended these to be. The mismatch between public explanation and scope is stark: DHS downplays it as minor (_“higher standards than most prisons,” they claim of ICE detention[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/migrants-moved-to-brooklyn-jail/#:~:text=The%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security,also%20responded%20with%20a%20statement)_), yet over a hundred people in Brooklyn and untold dozens cycling through Federal Plaza say otherwise. There is some **NGO and community pushback** – e.g. groups like New York Immigrant Family Unity Project and city public defenders have raised alarms about clients being whisked into “black holes” in Manhattan or MDC. The press coverage by CBS and THE CITY in July 2025 has at least pierced the veil of secrecy. But oversight remains a challenge, as both ICE and BOP are federal and can stonewall local officials.

 

**Hudson Valley and Courthouse Pipeline:** Outside NYC, we already covered Orange County Jail’s role. To add, we are also watching **federal building leases in the Hudson Valley or northern NJ**. ICE could, for instance, lease a disused commercial building via GSA and call it a “staging facility.” These sorts of leases might show up in opaque terms on GSA schedules (e.g. “warehouse space – tenant undisclosed”). We did not find a confirmed case of this in the Hudson Valley yet. One historical analog: in New Windsor, NY (Orange County), a plan for an ICE processing center at a former warehouse was floated years ago. Any revival of that kind of plan would likely be couched as “processing” or “holding center” not “detention camp,” to avoid alarm. So far, aside from Orange Jail, no new sites in the Hudson Valley have been reported, but given the volume of NYC arrests now, it’s plausible ICE will seek more space closer to the city. **Unmarked transport vans** have been noted by observers ferrying detainees from 26 Federal Plaza out to New Jersey or upstate in the evenings – another piece of the pipeline puzzle that is hard to document but known anecdotally.

### Washington D.C. & Maryland: Enforcement Surge Amid Facility Vacuum

The D.C./Maryland area illustrates a scenario where **ICE is ramping up enforcement but has zero local detention centers** – a recipe for hidden transfers and creative custody arrangements.

 

**Maryland’s Vanishing ICE Beds:** By 2021, Maryland had effectively eliminated ICE detention within the state. The last remaining contract – at the **Howard County Detention Center in Jessup, MD** – was terminated by County Executive Calvin Ball in May 2021[patch.com](https://patch.com/maryland/columbia/last-detainee-leaves-howard-county-detention-center#:~:text=JESSUP%2C%20MD%20%E2%80%94%20The%20U,detainees%20housed%20in%20Howard%20County)[patch.com](https://patch.com/maryland/columbia/last-detainee-leaves-howard-county-detention-center#:~:text=passionate%20engagement%20in%20regard%20to,Ball%20said%20in%20a%20statement). Howard County had even tried to limit ICE detainees to only those with violent crime convictions in late 2020, but ultimately opted to end the contract altogether[patch.com](https://patch.com/maryland/columbia/last-detainee-leaves-howard-county-detention-center#:~:text=In%20September%202020%2C%20the%20Howard,or%20convicted%20of%20jailable%20offenses). Prince George’s County had ended its ICE contract back in 2019, and Anne Arundel County followed suit around 2020. So, as of 2022–2023, ICE had **no county jail partners in Maryland**. This coincided with Biden-era detention downscaling. Detainees from the Baltimore ICE field office were being sent to places like the **Worcester County Jail on Maryland’s Eastern Shore** (which still had a 287(g) agreement and held some ICE detainees) or to **Farmville, VA** and other out-of-state sites.

 

Come 2025, with Trump back, ICE is arresting more people in the DC/Maryland region again (e.g. targeting noncitizens at criminal court appearances in Maryland, or conducting raids in the community). With no local ICE jail, those arrested are often **shipped out the same day to somewhere like York (before its closure) or now possibly Clinton County, PA or Caroline County, VA**. These transfers are opaque – families and lawyers sometimes struggle to find clients. It’s in this context that Maryland advocates pushed for a **state law to ban ICE detention and participation programs statewide** (to prevent any sheriff from reopening a contract). However, in April 2025, despite Democratic supermajorities, the Maryland legislature **failed to pass a 287(g) ban**[boltsmag.org](https://boltsmag.org/maryland-287g-contracts-with-ice-growing/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20amid%20President%20Trump%E2%80%99s,g%29%20counties)[boltsmag.org](https://boltsmag.org/maryland-287g-contracts-with-ice-growing/#:~:text=House%20Bill%201222,negotiations%20and%20opposing%20pressure%20campaigns). Instead, the bill was watered down to modest limits on data sharing. The reason? Some Democratic senators got **cold feet under pressure, citing Trump’s threats** and possibly fearing loss of federal funds[boltsmag.org](https://boltsmag.org/maryland-287g-contracts-with-ice-growing/#:~:text=Maryland%E2%80%99s%20GOP%20sheriffs%20are%20rushing,they%20worry%20about%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20threats)[boltsmag.org](https://boltsmag.org/maryland-287g-contracts-with-ice-growing/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20amid%20President%20Trump%E2%80%99s,g%29%20counties). This was described by advocates as _“a betrayal in slow motion,”_ as sheriffs in conservative counties rushed to sign up for 287(g) agreements in early 2025[boltsmag.org](https://boltsmag.org/maryland-287g-contracts-with-ice-growing/#:~:text=Several%20blue%20states%20have%20already,it%2C%20but%20Maryland%20has%20not). In fact, **four additional Maryland counties joined 287(g) just in the first two months of Trump’s term**, bringing the total to 7 counties (out of 24) cooperating with ICE[boltsmag.org](https://boltsmag.org/maryland-287g-contracts-with-ice-growing/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20amid%20President%20Trump%E2%80%99s,g%29%20counties). Notably, Frederick County’s Sheriff (longtime ICE ally Chuck Jenkins) has been a champion of this program. Under 287(g), _local jail deputies act as ICE agents_ inside the jail, screening and flagging inmates for ICE pickup. It basically deputizes the jail to start the detention process.

 

**Implications of 287(g) surge:** While 287(g) is not detention per se, it greatly _feeds_ the detention pipeline. For example, in Frederick County, MD, if an undocumented person is arrested for a minor offense (like driving without a license), sheriff’s deputies through 287(g) will notify ICE and hold the person for ICE after the local case is resolved[ice.gov](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-partnership-program-aids-apprehension-criminal-aliens-following-high-speed-chase#:~:text=ICE%20partnership%20program%20aids%20in,Adult%20Detention%20Center%20central%20booking)[frederickcosheriff.com](https://www.frederickcosheriff.com/287g-program#:~:text=MD%20www,perform%20limited%20immigration%20enforcement). ICE then needs to transfer that person to an ICE detention facility – which, given none are nearby, means a covert transport to somewhere else (often out of state). In one case in early 2025, a father of eight with no criminal record was detained by ICE in Frederick after a traffic court appearance, causing an outcry[nbcwashington.com](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/terrified-father-of-8-detained-by-ice-in-frederick-county/3893869/#:~:text=%27Terrified%27%3A%20Father%20of%208%20detained,he%20has%20no%20criminal%20record). These kinds of stories are emerging as enforcement tightens. The lack of local beds means **long-distance transfers** (sometimes via ICE Air flights out of **Manassas, VA or Harrisburg, PA**, which are known ICE flight hubs). It also means ICE might try to find **new local holding solutions**. One potential target could be the **Maryland Correctional system or federal facilities**. Jessup, MD (which hosts a cluster of state prisons and the now-empty Howard County ICE wing) stands out. Could ICE partner with, say, the Maryland Department of Public Safety to use a portion of a state prison as a “holding center”? It’d be controversial and likely require Governor’s approval, so probably not openly. More plausibly, ICE might use **FEMA or DHS emergency authority** to set up a “Temporary Regional Processing Center” at a federal site in Maryland. There were rumors (though no confirmation) that **FEMA had scouted warehouse space in the Baltimore area for migrant shelter use**, which could theoretically double as detention if ICE takes over. Our sources did not confirm any active FEMA/ICE co-use in Maryland at this time. This remains a speculative risk: emergency shelter missions can be transferred from FEMA to ICE if the administration chooses a more enforcement approach. The instruction for us was to shift focus away from FEMA, and indeed we haven’t seen FEMA openly running shelters for migrants in MD – the migrants arriving in DC/MD (for example via Texas’s buses to DC) have been sheltered by NGOs and local government, not detained.

 

**Washington D.C.:** The nation’s capital doesn’t have an ICE detention center (and DC jail does not hold ICE detainees). However, ICE field offices operate in DC and Northern Virginia. In 2025, DC has seen high-profile immigration policy battles (e.g. over “sanctuary” status and the handling of asylum-seekers bused from the border). The **federal-local coordination** here is often cloaked in national security terms. For instance, if ICE were to utilize a federal building in DC for processing, it might be labeled as a “joint task force center” for “migrant response” rather than a detention site. No specific DC site is known, but one can look at how January 2025’s inauguration events led to **sealed-off areas in DC for security** – such locations _could_ be repurposed by DHS for holding arrestees if mass raids occurred. We saw no evidence this has occurred yet for immigration, but given DC’s unique federal oversight, ICE has more freedom to operate there than in, say, a sanctuary city with local non-cooperation.

 

**Jessup & Federal Leases:** The brief mentioned Jessup specifically for overlapping FEMA/ICE contracts. Jessup houses DHS’s **Baltimore Field Office** (which includes ICE ERO operations) and is near several large warehouses. One can imagine a scenario where DHS designates a “Federal Emergency Staging Area” in Jessup for processing migrants (perhaps under the pretext of an influx from the border or disaster evacuees), which in practice functions as a holding center for ICE. As of our research, we did not find documentation of such a facility being stood up. But we did find that **Maryland’s lawmakers are wary** – they attempted to block ICE cooperation precisely to avoid backdoor detention in places like Jessup. The outcome (no ban, more 287(g)) shows the tension: politically, Maryland doesn’t welcome detention, yet structurally, ICE gained more allies in local law enforcement.

 

One bright spot: Montgomery County, PG County, Howard County – all populous counties – remain anti-detention, and DC’s Attorney General would likely challenge any covert jail in the capital. This pushes ICE to rely on the **expelling of detainees out of the region quickly**. We note some anecdotal reports: ICE Air flights have been seen leaving from **Andrews Air Force Base** in Maryland in past operations (usually to deport high-profile cases or quickly move detainees to other circuits). If such flights increased, it might be passed off as “standard removals” but could indicate a hidden pipeline from local 287(g) arrests to immediate deportation, bypassing prolonged detention. The lack of detention can sometimes mean **fast-tracking people out of the country**, which is arguably even less transparent if due process is compromised.

### Northern Border Areas: Vermont and Upstate NY Signals

While much attention is on the southern border, the **northern border** has quietly become an issue. Since 2022, the U.S. has seen a notable increase in asylum-seekers crossing from Canada (e.g. in rural Quebec–Vermont and Quebec–NY corridors). In response, enforcement along the northern border (Border Patrol’s Swanton Sector covering VT/NY/NH, and Buffalo Sector covering Niagara) intensified. This has led to **improvised detention and transfer operations in traditionally low-volume areas**:

 

**Vermont (Burlington Area):** Vermont has no ICE detention center. Border Patrol holds people short-term at stations like **Swanton, VT or Rouses Point, NY**, then typically hands them to ICE’s New England Field Office. Without local detention (the nearest ICE facility is in Boston or in Strafford County, NH), ICE has been **flying detainees out of Vermont’s Burlington International Airport**. A collective of local activists monitored the airport over recent months and discovered that **at least 450 people detained in immigration cases have been transferred through Burlington airport since January 2025**[vtdigger.org](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/16/advocates-say-they-helped-prevent-three-ice-detainees-from-being-flown-out-of-vermont/#:~:text=skyrocketed%20under%20the%20second%20Trump,at%20New%20York%E2%80%99s%20Syracuse%20University) – a huge number for Vermont. These transfers often happen in the early morning on chartered planes. In one remarkable case on July 16, 2025, activists at the airport noticed three ICE detainees (women) being escorted onto an American Airlines commercial flight. The activists raised alarms and somehow got local officials involved; in the end, the three women were **taken off the plane and returned to the state prison where they’d been held**[vtdigger.org](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/16/advocates-say-they-helped-prevent-three-ice-detainees-from-being-flown-out-of-vermont/#:~:text=In%20what%20could%20be%20the,been%20held%20for%20several%20days). ICE had planned to fly them likely to a detention center elsewhere (perhaps Louisiana or Texas). This incident suggests **possible cracks in ICE’s operations when exposed** – the airline may have balked at carrying detainees after activists shone a light, or ICE decided to avoid a scene. The women were being held at **Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility**, a Vermont state women’s prison. Vermont apparently allows short-term holding of ICE detainees in its prison under some federal-state agreement (likely an older IGSA that wasn’t much used, now being exploited due to the surge). The **public framing** in Vermont by activists is that these are _deportations skyrocketing under Trump’s policies_, and they want local airports and governments to stop facilitating. Airport commissioners in Burlington were confronted with data on ICE flights and asked to **“discontinue cooperation”** with these deportation transfers[vtdigger.org](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/16/advocates-say-they-helped-prevent-three-ice-detainees-from-being-flown-out-of-vermont/#:~:text=This%20surprising%20turn%20of%20events,at%20New%20York%E2%80%99s%20Syracuse%20University)[vtdigger.org](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/16/advocates-say-they-helped-prevent-three-ice-detainees-from-being-flown-out-of-vermont/#:~:text=A%20study%20the%20loose%20group,since%20the%20start%20of%20January). It’s unclear what power the airport has, but this pressure itself is notable – it’s shining light on a previously invisible step in the pipeline.

 

**Upstate NY & VT sites:** We have also heard of Border Patrol temporarily using places like **old Border Patrol posts or local fairgrounds** to hold groups of border-crossers until transport arrives. For instance, in Montana (another northern sector) there were reports of BP using warehouse space for overflow. In our region (VT/Upstate NY), nothing concrete like that surfaced in media, but one can envision BP parking lots with tents in summer if crossings spike. Northern border towns (e.g. **Massena, NY; Newport, VT; Plattsburgh, NY**) are on watch lists, because an influx could prompt ICE to set up “soft-sided facilities” (aka tent camps) near highway junctions or small airports. Any such facility might be labeled as a **“temporary migrant processing center”** run by CBP or FEMA. We have not found evidence of such an installation yet. The closest analog is the use of the border bridges in Buffalo/Niagara which we discussed – not tents, but repurposing existing customs buildings.

 

One must also consider the **cross-border coordination**: For example, U.S. and Canada recently revised the Safe Third Country Agreement to allow turning back asylum-seekers. If that fails and more come through, DHS might justify “emergency shelter” setups in northern states. These could in effect detain people waiting for removal hearings. Without overt news, we flag it as a risk.

 

**Community Pushback:** In Vermont, the group Migrant Justice and others have been vocal. They frame the issue as **local communities unwittingly aiding ICE** (through airports and local jails). Their successful intervention in stopping a deportation flight is a rare win. It indicates that **whistleblower warnings can come from ordinary citizens** – e.g. someone noticing DHS personnel at an airport at 4am and alerting activists. Social media has played a role here: activists share flight tail numbers, describe van sightings, etc. ICE Air operations usually operate under chartered aliases (e.g. World Atlantic Airlines, iAero, etc.), which are hard to trace unless you know what to look for. The Vermont crew did meticulous tracking; they even got details like detainees’ “A-numbers” from glimpsing paperwork[vtdigger.org](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/16/advocates-say-they-helped-prevent-three-ice-detainees-from-being-flown-out-of-vermont/#:~:text=the%20movement%20of%20ICE%20detainees,through%20the%20airport)[vtdigger.org](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/16/advocates-say-they-helped-prevent-three-ice-detainees-from-being-flown-out-of-vermont/#:~:text=clothes%20official%2C%20the%20two%20activists,said). This kind of citizen monitoring is likely to expand in other regions as official transparency shrinks.

 

**Summary of Mismatch (North):** Publicly, there’s almost no acknowledgment of a northern border detention issue. It’s all couched in terms of “border security.” Yet behind the scenes, hundreds of people are being held in **ad hoc facilities** – from **county jails to airport holding rooms** – far from the public eye. It’s early-stage in the sense that ICE/CBP are stretching facilities never meant for this. If the trend continues, one could foresee a more formal **“Northern Border Processing Center”** being proposed (perhaps at a decommissioned site like the former Plattsburgh Air Force Base or similar). If so, it would likely be sold as a _“semi-permanent FEMA or DHS facility for emergency use”_ – language that obfuscates the true detainee prison it would be. The lesson from Vermont is that even small-scale, hidden operations can be uncovered with diligent local oversight, which then forces ICE to adjust tactics (at least for that day).

## 3. Barriers & Limitations in Uncovering These Operations

Identifying these early-stage detention activities is challenging due to several deliberate and structural barriers:

- **Opaque Contracting and Permitting:** Many of these expansions occur through mechanisms that avoid public disclosure. For instance, ICE can amend an existing contract (as with GEO Group’s Delaney Hall deal) without open bidding, or use an **Intergovernmental Service Agreement (IGSA)** that is simply an agreement between ICE and a county sheriff. Such agreements often do not require a public vote or announcement. In Newark’s case, GEO tried to operate **without applying for new local permits** at all[newjerseyglobe.com](https://newjerseyglobe.com/immigration/ice-opens-newark-detention-center-amid-lawsuit-over-permits-inspections/#:~:text=for%20GEO%20Group%20told%20the,had%20received%20the%20inspection%20report). The only reason we know of violations is Newark’s lawsuit. If a facility is on federal property, even basic local permits (building codes, occupancy certificates) might be argued as not required. This severely limits transparency – by the time a facility is housing people, it may be too late for local intervention.
    
- **Coded Language and Rebranding:** As noted, agencies are using euphemisms like “temporary shelter,” “processing center,” or “holding facility” to describe what are, in effect, detention sites. This **vague public language cloaks the true scope**. A city council agenda might mention “disaster response coordination” which could actually involve constructing migrant holding areas. For example, council members in some cities have been asked to approve “emergency management” MoUs with FEMA that quietly include ICE participation. Without vigilant reading of fine print (which is often not publicly available), these arrangements slide through. The brief specifically warned to watch for terms like _“federal partnerships”_ and _“migrant coordination”_ – those can be catch-all phrases that involve ICE. As a limitation, unless a whistleblower shares the content, the public might not realize a given initiative involves detention or deportation.
    
- **Access Denied and Information Blackouts:** We saw ICE literally **bar oversight officials from facilities by claiming technicalities** (26 Federal Plaza incident)[thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/18/ice-nadler-goldman-federal-detention-manhattan/#:~:text=Two%20members%20of%20Congress%20were,unannounced%20visits%20for%20oversight%20purposes)[thecity.nyc](https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/06/18/ice-nadler-goldman-federal-detention-manhattan/#:~:text=Spokespeople%20for%20ICE%20and%20the,respond%20to%20requests%20for%20comment). This is emblematic – even legally entitled inspectors are being kept out. For journalists and NGOs, ICE often denies FOIA requests or heavily redacts them, especially around “enforcement sensitive” information like facility locations and transport records. _Irregular procurement_ details (like purchase orders for fencing, cots, cameras) that might tip off a new facility are frequently marked as sensitive or are done through third parties, making FOIA retrieval slow. For instance, a purchase of 100 beds could be done by a contractor (GEO) rather than ICE directly, evading federal records disclosure. We encountered sources noting **FOIA delays and litigation** – e.g. the ACLU had to sue to get info on ICE’s plans in NJ[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-new-information-regarding-ices-plans-to-expand-immigration-detention-in-new-jersey#:~:text=,The%20ACLU%20of%20New). This time lag means by the time documents come out, facilities may already be active.
    
- **Sealed Court Dockets and Gag Orders:** There are reports (though we didn’t have direct citations in our sources) that some legal proceedings related to these operations are sealed. For example, if the federal government leases a site and a neighbor sues, the case might be sealed for “national security.” Even the Newark vs. GEO lawsuit, while public, had parts where ICE filed statements under seal (e.g. ICE likely provided a plan of operations to the judge that we can’t see). Contractors sometimes require NDAs for subcontractors, so workers installing, say, surveillance cameras at a site can’t talk about it. This culture of secrecy makes whistleblowing risky – employees of private contractors fear legal repercussions if they speak out about an unannounced facility.
    
- **Irregular Data and Transit Records:** Tracking the movement of detainees is extremely hard. ICE’s public **Detention Locator** often lags or omits people who are in transit or at nontraditional sites. In the Orange County case, immigrants were moved without notice[citylimits.org](https://citylimits.org/tag/orange-county-jail/#:~:text=,From%20NY%20Jail%20Without%20Notice) – lawyers found out only after clients called from Mississippi. ICE Air flight data is not published; one must use flight tracker tools and know specific charter companies or tail numbers. These charters can be disguised as “employee shuttles” or other federal flights. Local airports usually don’t scrutinize federal charters. Additionally, **transport by bus or van** leaves almost no trail – no publicly available logs of unmarked white buses on interstates. Only through stakeouts or serendipitous sightings do we get hints (like Vermont activists at 4am observing a DHS van)[vtdigger.org](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/16/advocates-say-they-helped-prevent-three-ice-detainees-from-being-flown-out-of-vermont/#:~:text=the%20movement%20of%20ICE%20detainees,through%20the%20airport). Our research was limited by this lack of official data; we relied on investigative journalism and advocacy reports to piece together transit patterns.
    
- **Decentralization and Outsourcing to Private Entities:** The involvement of private contractors and lesser-known entities muddies the waters. Companies like **Akima, CoreCivic, GEO Group, The GEO-owned subsidiaries, and even security firms like Allied Universal or Triple Canopy** often carry out tasks (from guarding to transportation) without the ICE logo. For example, Akima runs Batavia detention, so any job postings or procurements go through Akima, not ICE – someone scanning federal job sites wouldn’t see “ICE hiring guards” but Akima or “AGS” (Akima Global Services) ads which are not obviously linked to immigration. The brief also mentioned **Urban Alchemy** (a nonprofit known for homeless services) and **Dynamic Service Solutions** – we did not find them in our sources, but it’s plausible such organizations could get contracts to manage “migrant shelters” that end up functioning as detention lite. If, say, a nonprofit gets a big federal grant and gives donations to local officials (or hires politically connected individuals), that could grease the wheels for a facility opening quietly. Investigating those money flows is beyond the scope of what we could quickly do, but it’s a known risk (the so-called “shadow contractor” network).
    
- **FOIA and Legal Delays:** Advocacy groups have filed FOIAs for contracts, emails, and inspections (e.g. Detention Watch Network and others). The government’s response is often slow or incomplete. By the time documents confirming a plan (say, to convert a youth facility into ICE use) are released, the work may be done. FOIA litigation can take a year or more – too slow to act as an early warning. We noted that even the DHS OIG inspections, when they happen, come after the fact. For instance, serious issues at Batavia were only documented in OIG audits in 2023[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/02/20/521935/#:~:text=In%20one%2C%20in%20which%20auditors,when%20doing%20so%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20necessary)[investigativepost.org](https://www.investigativepost.org/2025/02/20/521935/#:~:text=Auditors%20were%20again%20on%20site,%E2%80%9D), long after detainees had suffered under those conditions.
    
- **Deliberate Misinformation or Concealment:** In some cases, officials just outright deny what’s happening until they can’t. When NJ activists heard rumblings of a new ICE site in 2024, officials were mum until the court or contract was in hand. In Vermont, an ICE spokesperson initially tried to downplay activists’ claims about stopping a flight, and the airline denied making the decision – implying maybe ICE halted it for other reasons. This kind of obfuscation makes it hard to pinpoint cause and effect. We have to rely on corroborated accounts and assume some degree of spin from agencies.
    

Given all these barriers, our findings are necessarily piecemeal. We connected the dots where possible through news reports and advocacy information. Where we did _not_ find information (e.g. no evidence of Delaware activity or Jessup FEMA site), we reported that absence – but we remain cautious that “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.” The infrastructure buildup we did document (in NJ, NY, PA, etc.) shows clear patterns: preference for _low-visibility arrangements_, use of **private contractors and federal facilities to sidestep local laws**, and **last-minute or no notice activations**. Continued monitoring will require on-the-ground intelligence, such as attending county meetings (for hints of unusual funding or closed sessions about “federal partners”), tracking job listings (e.g. sudden demand for bilingual security staff in a town), and following the money (any large “emergency management” grants flowing to these regions).

 

In conclusion, early indicators of ICE detention expansion are present across the target region – from Newark’s stealth mega-jail, to Buffalo’s fragmented holding network, to Manhattan’s office-floor lockup. Each case features a **mismatch between public narrative and actual activity scope**. The challenge is cutting through the official smokescreens. We did so here by aggregating investigative findings and citing concrete evidence whenever available. However, some suspicions (like contractor political donations or FEMA cover usage) remain difficult to prove without further deep-dive research or insider leaks. Those remain on our watchlist as potential facilitators of these “quiet” detention operations moving forward.
