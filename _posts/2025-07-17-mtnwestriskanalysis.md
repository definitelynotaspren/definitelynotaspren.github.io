## Colorado: Early Signs of ICE Detention Expansion

[cpr.org](https://www.cpr.org/2025/07/10/proposed-ice-detention-facilities-colorado-aclu/#:~:text=In%20the%20wake%20of%20the,made%20the%20list%20for%20consideration)[cpr.org](https://www.cpr.org/2025/07/10/proposed-ice-detention-facilities-colorado-aclu/#:~:text=owned%20and%20are%20currently%20not,in%20operation)**Colorado emerged as a focal point for planned ICE detention expansion**, with six inactive facilities identified in FOIA disclosures as potential sites[aclu-co.org](https://www.aclu-co.org/en/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-new-information-about-plans-expand-ice-detention#:~:text=The%20115%20pages%20disclosed%20by,The%20facilities%20include)[aclu-co.org](https://www.aclu-co.org/en/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-new-information-about-plans-expand-ice-detention#:~:text=,was%20shut%20down%20in%202014). These include four traditional prisons and two additional options (a nursing home and a tent camp). While no detainees have yet been moved into these locations as of early July, **evidence of preparatory steps and local responses has begun to surface**:

- **Hudson Correctional Facility (Hudson, CO)** – A private prison built in 2009 (empty since 2014) was pitched to ICE by its owner, Highlands REIT[denver7.com](https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/its-not-about-being-political-town-of-hudson-leadership-open-to-potential-ice-detention-facility#:~:text=Roughly%2030%20miles%20northeast%20of,the%20locations%20pitched%20to%20ICE)[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/private-prison-companies-ice-plans-expand-colorado-detention-capacity/#:~:text=Image%3A%20ice,CBS). ICE’s internal notes praised it as “very well maintained” and **quick to reopen (within ~6 months)**[denver7.com](https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/its-not-about-being-political-town-of-hudson-leadership-open-to-potential-ice-detention-facility#:~:text=Roughly%2030%20miles%20northeast%20of,the%20locations%20pitched%20to%20ICE). **Local stance:** Hudson’s town leadership has previously signaled neutrality or support, prioritizing economic benefits over politics. Hudson’s Mayor Joe Hammock indicated the town’s influence is limited given its small size and private ownership of the prison[denver7.com](https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/its-not-about-being-political-town-of-hudson-leadership-open-to-potential-ice-detention-facility#:~:text=,said%20Hudson%20Mayor%20Joe%20Hammock). To date, **no building permits or job listings explicitly tied to reopening Hudson have been found**, which is expected since ICE has not formally contracted it yet. Town records since June 10 show no agenda items on the prison, suggesting any negotiations remain behind closed doors. **Confidence:** High – The site was explicitly named in ICE’s RFI response documents[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/private-prison-companies-ice-plans-expand-colorado-detention-capacity/#:~:text=Image%3A%20ice,CBS). **Red flags:** If reactivated, oversight will largely fall to ICE and a contracted operator (possibly GEO Group, which leased it previously[krdo.com](https://krdo.com/news/2025/07/10/feds-eye-colorado-springs-for-two-new-ice-detention-centers/#:~:text=The%20three%20other%20potential%20Colorado,locations%20include)), not the town, raising transparency concerns.
    
- **Huerfano County Correctional Center (Walsenburg, CO)** – CoreCivic’s shuttered prison (closed 2010) is another prime candidate with **752 beds** ready for use[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/private-prison-companies-ice-plans-expand-colorado-detention-capacity/#:~:text=The%20company%20CoreCivic%20states%2C%20,a%20capacity%20for%20752%20beds). CoreCivic’s proposal to ICE claims the facility _“can begin a staged ramp 120 days after contract commencement”_[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/private-prison-companies-ice-plans-expand-colorado-detention-capacity/#:~:text=The%20company%20CoreCivic%20states%2C%20,a%20capacity%20for%20752%20beds), suggesting minimal renovation needed. **Local response:** County commissioners discussed the prospect after receiving an anonymous email of concern on July 1. They publicly stated the county has _“absolutely no say”_ since it’s a private facility[worldjournalnewspaper.com](https://worldjournalnewspaper.com/commissioners-approve-sandoz-opioid-settlement-agreement/#:~:text=Commission%20Chairman%20Karl%20Sporleder%20said,interested%20in%20a%20CoreCivic%20property). Commissioner Karl Sporleder emphasized _“it’s not a county facility…we don’t have a dog in this fight”_[worldjournalnewspaper.com](https://worldjournalnewspaper.com/commissioners-approve-sandoz-opioid-settlement-agreement/#:~:text=Commission%20Chairman%20Karl%20Sporleder%20said,interested%20in%20a%20CoreCivic%20property). This hands-off stance implies no local permit hurdles – the zoning for prison use is already in place. Walsenburg city leaders, meanwhile, appear cautiously optimistic about any economic infusion. In a TV report, Walsenburg officials were _“less concerned with the politics and ethics”_ of ICE’s deportation agenda and _“just want the economic boost”_ from reopening the prison[twitter.com](https://twitter.com/KyleClark/status/1943360479880990780#:~:text=,with%20the%20politics%20and)[twitter.com](https://twitter.com/RichardWyl39256/status/1936401587145933292#:~:text=Rich%20on%20X%3A%20,PM%20%C2%B7%20Jun%2021%2C%202025). **On-the-ground activity:** No construction permits have been filed in Huerfano County for the CoreCivic site as of this writing. However, subtle signs of readiness might not require permits (e.g. cleaning, basic maintenance). **Social media chatter:** Some local residents (and even outsiders) on platforms like X (Twitter) have cheered on using the _“empty prison in Walsenburg… for an illegal alien detainment center”_, with one user saying _“Bring it on”_[twitter.com](https://twitter.com/RichardWyl39256/status/1936401587145933292#:~:text=Rich%20on%20X%3A%20,PM%20%C2%B7%20Jun%2021%2C%202025). On the other hand, regional immigrant-rights groups are mobilizing; Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition and ACLU leaders condemn any new detention as profiteering from human suffering[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/private-prison-companies-ice-plans-expand-colorado-detention-capacity/#:~:text=,profit%20system). **Confidence:** High – CoreCivic’s intent is documented, and local officials acknowledge the possibility[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/private-prison-companies-ice-plans-expand-colorado-detention-capacity/#:~:text=The%20company%20CoreCivic%20states%2C%20,a%20capacity%20for%20752%20beds)[worldjournalnewspaper.com](https://worldjournalnewspaper.com/commissioners-approve-sandoz-opioid-settlement-agreement/#:~:text=Commission%20Chairman%20Karl%20Sporleder%20said,interested%20in%20a%20CoreCivic%20property). **Red flags:** A rapid ramp-up (120 days) means the facility could be operational with little public notice. Transparency issues are likely, and past rumors swirling since early 2025 have already created community tensions (e.g. _Huerfano World Journal_ noted speculation about ICE interest right after Inauguration Day)[cpr.org](https://www.cpr.org/2025/07/10/proposed-ice-detention-facilities-colorado-aclu/#:~:text=Huerfano%20County%2C%20which%20has%20one,to%20the%20Huerfano%20World%20Journal).

Key locations include Hudson (north), Colorado Springs area (center), La Junta (southeast), and Walsenburg (south). A “soft-sided” tent facility was also proposed in Walsenburg[aclu-co.org](https://www.aclu-co.org/en/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-new-information-about-plans-expand-ice-detention#:~:text=,a%20former%20skilled%20nursing%20facility)._

- **“Soft-Sided” Tent Facility (Walsenburg area, CO)** – In addition to the fixed prison, ICE considered an **open-air camp using modular tents** in southern Colorado[aclu-co.org](https://www.aclu-co.org/en/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-new-information-about-plans-expand-ice-detention#:~:text=,a%20former%20skilled%20nursing%20facility). Texas-based **Apex Site Services** pitched this concept, boasting experience building temporary facilities for thousands of people[cpr.org](https://www.cpr.org/2025/07/10/proposed-ice-detention-facilities-colorado-aclu/#:~:text=The%20ACLU%20documents%20reveal%20that,for%20state%20and%20federal%20entities). The plan likely involved a large tract of land in Huerfano County where tents or sprung structures could be erected quickly. Another entity, BHPE LLC (Begini Howard Private Equity), also submitted proposals, possibly to finance or develop such a camp[aclu-co.org](https://www.aclu-co.org/en/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-new-information-about-plans-expand-ice-detention#:~:text=,a%20former%20skilled%20nursing%20facility). **Current status:** No visible move to break ground on a tent city so far. **Local oversight:** This _would_ presumably require county permits for utilities and assembly structures, but none have surfaced. It’s possible ICE treats it as a contingency if the brick-and-mortar prison faces delays or overflow. **Confidence:** Moderate – existence of the proposal is confirmed by FOIA[aclu-co.org](https://www.aclu-co.org/en/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-new-information-about-plans-expand-ice-detention#:~:text=,a%20former%20skilled%20nursing%20facility), but activation seems contingent and speculative at this stage. **Red flags:** A sudden push to construct a tent facility would be a strong indicator of imminent mass detention (and would likely draw public attention due to its scale). Continued monitoring of county commission agendas and any large orders for tents, fencing, or generators in the area is warranted.
    
- **Cheyenne Mountain Reentry Center (Colorado Springs, CO)** – A formerly state-contracted prison in Colorado Springs, closed in March 2020 as Colorado moved away from private prisons[krdo.com](https://krdo.com/news/2025/07/10/feds-eye-colorado-springs-for-two-new-ice-detention-centers/#:~:text=The%20Cheyenne%20Mountain%20Reentry%20Center,companies%20in%20the%20United%20States), now stands as a ready-made ICE detention site. GEO Group, which owns the facility, has **proposed to ICE a capacity of ~700 detainees** there[krdo.com](https://krdo.com/news/2025/07/10/feds-eye-colorado-springs-for-two-new-ice-detention-centers/#:~:text=Geo%20Group%20already%20runs%20Colorado%27s,capacity%20for%20over%201%2C500%20detainees)[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/private-prison-companies-ice-plans-expand-colorado-detention-capacity/#:~:text=GEO%2C%20which%20already%20operates%20the,facility%20and%20detainee%20support%20services). They highlight its strategic location _“close to all necessary facility and detainee support services”_ in Colorado Springs[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/private-prison-companies-ice-plans-expand-colorado-detention-capacity/#:~:text=GEO%2C%20which%20already%20operates%20the,facility%20and%20detainee%20support%20services) (e.g. hospitals, transportation hubs). **Local reaction:** Not much public debate has occurred in the Springs yet. This site is on Las Vegas Street in an industrial part of the city, which may be why it hasn’t drawn the same attention as small-town proposals. City officials have not held specific hearings on it in the past month. Notably, Colorado’s state government had previously been glad to shed this facility in 2020 due to concerns over private prison management[krdo.com](https://krdo.com/news/2025/07/10/feds-eye-colorado-springs-for-two-new-ice-detention-centers/#:~:text=The%20Cheyenne%20Mountain%20Reentry%20Center,companies%20in%20the%20United%20States) – reopening it for ICE undercuts that reform, but since it’s purely federal use, state law likely doesn’t prohibit it. **Operational signs:** Thus far, **no new job postings explicitly for Cheyenne Mountain have been found** in June/July. GEO Group may be waiting for a contract award before hiring. (In a similar scenario in Kansas, CoreCivic tried to staff a site preemptively and was stopped by a court[latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-06-16/ice-is-using-no-bid-contracts-boosting-big-firms-to-get-more-detention-beds#:~:text=A%20judge%20has%20halted%20CoreCivic,permit%20from%20frustrated%20city%20officials), so companies might tread carefully.) However, GEO could potentially transfer experienced staff from its Aurora ICE facility or other prisons to jump-start operations quietly. **Confidence:** High – GEO’s intent and ICE’s interest are well-documented[krdo.com](https://krdo.com/news/2025/07/10/feds-eye-colorado-springs-for-two-new-ice-detention-centers/#:~:text=Geo%20Group%20already%20runs%20Colorado%27s,capacity%20for%20over%201%2C500%20detainees)[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/private-prison-companies-ice-plans-expand-colorado-detention-capacity/#:~:text=GEO%2C%20which%20already%20operates%20the,facility%20and%20detainee%20support%20services). **Red flags:** If ICE green-lights this site, expect capacity at Aurora (1,500-bed facility in Aurora, CO) to expand by 700 more in the state[krdo.com](https://krdo.com/news/2025/07/10/feds-eye-colorado-springs-for-two-new-ice-detention-centers/#:~:text=Image). Any such move could prompt local protests, given Aurora’s detention center has been _“notorious for…inhumane conditions”_ in the past[aclu-co.org](https://www.aclu-co.org/en/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-new-information-about-plans-expand-ice-detention#:~:text=%E2%80%9CCurrent%20immigration%20detention%20sites%2C%20including,profit%20detention%20machine.%E2%80%9D). Colorado Springs officials might face pressure to respond once formally announced.
    
- **La Junta/Baptiste Migrant Detention Facility (La Junta, CO)** – This facility, in rural Otero County, was a former youth/“boys’ ranch” campus that the **Baptiste Group** repurposed to hold immigrant minors or families during previous surges. It last saw use in 2023[aclu-co.org](https://www.aclu-co.org/en/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-new-information-about-plans-expand-ice-detention#:~:text=incarcerated%20Alaska%20state%20prisoners%20under,was%20shut%20down%20in%202014), after which it was emptied. The FOIA records show Baptiste offered it again to ICE for the new expansion[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/private-prison-companies-ice-plans-expand-colorado-detention-capacity/#:~:text=Image%3A%20ice,CBS). Capacity isn’t clearly stated in FOIA, but it’s presumably a few hundred beds (likely dormitory style housing). **Context:** The Baptiste Group’s track record is checkered – Tennessee suspended its license in 2021 after abuse and neglect scandals at a child migrant facility[aclu-co.org](https://www.aclu-co.org/en/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-new-information-about-plans-expand-ice-detention#:~:text=,at%20a%20migrant%20children%E2%80%99s%20facility). That history raises “red flags” if they re-enter Colorado’s detention scene. **Local angle:** The City of La Junta or Otero County officials have been relatively quiet publicly. It’s possible informal talks are happening, but no permits or council meeting notes (June–July) have emerged about reactivating the site. The facility, being private, might not need new zoning approval for similar use. **State oversight:** If this facility is used for adults in ICE custody (not children), state childcare licensing wouldn’t apply, potentially reducing regulatory scrutiny. **Confidence:** High – identified in FOIA and by name[aclu-co.org](https://www.aclu-co.org/en/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-new-information-about-plans-expand-ice-detention#:~:text=,was%20shut%20down%20in%202014). **Red flags:** Reopening might happen with little fanfare given its remote location. Any surge of contracts for local services (food catering, cleaning, etc.) in the La Junta area could be a tip-off that it’s gearing up. So far, none have been evident in public job boards or newspapers.
    
- **Colorado Springs – Parkmoor Drive site (Baptiste Group)** – A second Baptiste-owned property, a former skilled nursing facility at 3625 Parkmoor Village Dr. in Colorado Springs, was on ICE’s potential list[aclu-co.org](https://www.aclu-co.org/en/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-new-information-about-plans-expand-ice-detention#:~:text=abuse%20at%20a%20migrant%20children%E2%80%99s,facility). **New development:** This property was **sold in June to CommuniCare**, a healthcare company, whose representative explicitly stated they have _“no plans to use the site for any ICE-related purposes.”_[krdo.com](https://krdo.com/news/2025/07/10/feds-eye-colorado-springs-for-two-new-ice-detention-centers/#:~:text=Editor%27s%20note%3A%20On%20July%2010%2C,documents%20dated%20February%2017%2C%202025). This effectively removes the Parkmoor location from consideration. It’s a notable example of plans shifting on the ground since the FOIA data (which was dated February 2025). **Implication:** ICE lost one option in Colorado Springs, potentially making Cheyenne Mountain (discussed above) the primary focus in that city. **Confidence:** High – confirmed via county records and media[krdo.com](https://krdo.com/news/2025/07/10/feds-eye-colorado-springs-for-two-new-ice-detention-centers/#:~:text=report%20was%20based%20on%20documents,dated%20February%2017%2C%202025). **Notes:** This sale might have been influenced by Baptiste Group’s legal troubles or community pressure. It underscores that some proposed sites are in flux and not all will come to fruition.
    

**Overall in Colorado**, **multiple “irons in the fire” are being kept hot by ICE and its contractors**. None of the new detention centers have officially opened or announced contracts as of July 12, 2025, but preparations are poised to advance rapidly. ICE received an unprecedented **$45 billion from Congress to expand detention**[cpr.org](https://www.cpr.org/2025/07/10/proposed-ice-detention-facilities-colorado-aclu/#:~:text=In%20the%20wake%20of%20the,made%20the%20list%20for%20consideration), and internal planning is far along. The lack of visible public bids (e.g. on SAM.gov) suggests ICE may be leveraging **no-bid or expedited contracts** through existing vendors – indeed, ICE put out a “strategic sourcing” solicitation in April to streamline adding capacity[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=misconduct%20and%20abuse%20%E2%80%93%20which,immigration%20detention%20and%20related%20services). This means that once political go-ahead is given, these Colorado sites could activate with minimal warning, catching communities off guard.

 

**Flight Activity & Transfers:** Thus far, there have been no reports of ICE air transfers directly into the new Colorado locations (e.g. no charter flights unloading detainees in Walsenburg or Colorado Springs). Activist trackers of ICE Air note that June 2025 saw a **record-high number of ICE flights (1,187 total legs)** – a 10% jump over the previous peak[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=facilities%20in%2010%20states%20across,immigration%20detention%20and%20related%20services). The bulk of these were deportation and shuttling flights from border regions, but **it signals ramped-up enforcement nationwide**. Should Colorado’s new facilities open, one would expect to see “shuffle flights” moving detainees from Texas, Arizona, or Florida into Colorado’s airports (likely Denver or Colorado Springs) for custody. We are watching for any unusual DHS-chartered landings in Colorado. (As an aside, an arrangement exists for ICE to use Buckley Space Force Base in Aurora as overflow detention[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ice-use-us-military-base-colorado-detain-migrants-2025-01-29/#:~:text=ICE%20to%20use%20U,Space%20Force%20Base%20in), but there’s no evidence it’s been utilized in this timeframe.) The **absence of flight or transfer chatter involving Colorado indicates no mass influx yet**, consistent with the fact that facilities are not operational. This could change on very short notice.

## Wyoming: Proposal Floated and Faltered

**Wyoming, which has no ICE detention centers currently, saw an attempt to establish one** in the past few months – an effort that has stalled in the face of local resistance. In late March 2025, representatives from **Sabot Consulting** pitched the **Kemmerer City Council** on building a **900-bed ICE detention center**[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=Last%20week%2C%20a%20company%20called,Immigrations%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement). The plan was quite elaborate: the city of Kemmerer would issue bonds to finance construction, effectively owning the facility, and an Alaska Native corporation named **Akima** (a known federal contractor in detention operations) would operate it under an ICE contract[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=Construction%20of%20the%20facility%20would,contract%20with%20the%20federal%20government). Sabot Consulting’s role was as a facilitator between ICE, the city, and Akima[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=Sabot%E2%80%99s%20role%20was%20to%20work,Chiappinelli%20told%20the%20city%20council). This public-private partnership model was presented as a _“boon”_ to the region’s coal-reliant economy – promising jobs and revenue to a town of only ~2,800 people[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=Andrew%20Graham%20WyoFile)[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=Sabot%E2%80%99s%20role%20was%20to%20work,Chiappinelli%20told%20the%20city%20council).

 

**Public and official response:** The reception in Kemmerer was overwhelmingly negative. Residents packed the meeting and voiced strong opposition to the idea of an “immigration jail” in their community[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=Last%20week%2C%20a%20company%20called,Immigrations%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement)[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=But%20the%20proposal%20got%20a,two%20council%20members%20told%20WyoFile). By April 1, Kemmerer’s mayor and council unequivocally rejected the proposal – _“We can’t do it, and we don’t want it,”_ as Councilman Bill Ellis put it[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=constituents%20to%20keep%20it%20on,WyoFile%20the%20city%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20interested). The mayor confirmed there was “no interest” among officials or constituents to pursue it further[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThere%E2%80%99s%20no%20interest%20among%20council,WyoFile%20the%20city%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20interested). This swift rejection appears to have shelved the project; **no further action** has been reported in Kemmerer since.

 

**Wider context in WY:** The ICE Request for Information underlying this pitch sought a site within a two-hour drive of Salt Lake City’s airport[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20said%2C%20%E2%80%98We%20can%E2%80%99t%20do,don%E2%80%99t%20want%20it%2C%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D%20he%20said). Kemmerer fit that geography. It’s notable that Sabot first approached Kemmerer’s leaders as far back as May 2024, under the prior federal administration[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=deport%20immigrants%20%E2%80%94%20both%20those,former%20President%20Joe%20Biden%E2%80%99s%20administration). Thus, the groundwork was being laid quietly even before President Trump was inaugurated in 2025 and openly pushed mass deportation. This suggests **ICE and consultants were probing Wyoming early, expecting political winds to shift**. Also worth noting: Kemmerer wasn’t the only Wyoming locality approached. Nearby **Uinta County** (site of a previously contentious private prison proposal in 2017–2020) also got feelers from what officials believe was Sabot Consulting, regarding an ICE facility[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=Representatives%20for%20Sabot%20Consulting%20did,he%20believed%20was%20also%20Sabot). Uinta County commissioners likewise declined to bite. Even though Wyoming’s state political climate is generally very supportive of Trump’s immigration agenda[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=The%20reluctance%20to%20engage%20with,line%20with%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20deportation%20agenda), local “Not In My Backyard” sentiments transcended partisan alignment in this case. Officials recognized that **ideological support for deportations didn’t translate into willingness to host a detention center** in their transitioning local economy[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=Kemmerer%20is%20the%20county%20seat,transition%2C%20the%20council%20members%20said) (Kemmerer is trying to reinvent itself with projects like a new nuclear power plant, and residents likely saw an ICE jail as a step backward).

 

**Key takeaway for WY:** At least for now, **no ICE detention facility is moving forward in Wyoming**. The Sabot proposal’s collapse in Kemmerer indicates that any similar endeavor would meet heavy scrutiny. However, Sabot Consulting’s FOIA-revealed plans indicate they saw Wyoming as a ripe target absent state law barriers. **Confidence:** High that the Kemmerer project is dead (clear public statements)[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThere%E2%80%99s%20no%20interest%20among%20council,WyoFile%20the%20city%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20interested), but **monitoring is ongoing**. Sabot or others could quietly court a different town or county with sweeter financial incentives or less public attention. Until Trump’s initiative either fades or succeeds, Wyoming remains a potential location on ICE’s radar – just one that will require careful local buy-in, as the loud public opposition demonstrated.

## Utah: Legal Barriers and Low Visibility

In Utah, no specific site has been publicly identified for new ICE detention, but **plans certainly exist behind the scenes**. The ACLU’s nationwide FOIA release notes that **Sabot Consulting submitted a proposal involving Utah**, and it flags a major hurdle: _“potentially problematic statutory requirements”_ in Utah law[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=Sabot%20Consulting%20also%20submitted%20a,TX%2C%20previously%20used%20to%20hold). This refers to **state legislation that effectively prevents private prisons from operating in Utah without state or local agreement**. Utah previously passed laws to stop the construction of private immigrant detention centers after a proposed ICE facility in Evanston, WY (near the UT border) stirred controversy years ago. In essence, ICE cannot simply drop a private detention center in Utah unless it partners with the Utah Department of Corrections or gets explicit local approval – a safeguard that has so far deterred new facilities.

 

**Salt Lake City Field Office RFI:** ICE’s internal search (from which Sabot’s pitch stemmed) was looking for an **850–950 bed facility within 2 hours of Salt Lake City Airport**[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20said%2C%20%E2%80%98We%20can%E2%80%99t%20do,don%E2%80%99t%20want%20it%2C%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D%20he%20said). This radius includes much of Utah’s populated Wasatch Front, as well as parts of Wyoming and Idaho. Sabot’s mention of Utah law suggests they considered a Utah location (perhaps near Salt Lake or Ogden), but recognized it couldn’t happen _“absent a contract with the state DOC.”_[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=Sabot%20Consulting%20also%20submitted%20a,TX%2C%20previously%20used%20to%20hold) To date, there’s no indication Utah’s state government is entertaining such a contract; the current governor and legislature have been quiet on the matter this year.

 

**Current status:** Because of these legal constraints, **no permit filings or council discussions in Utah have been detected related to ICE detention centers** in the past month. There have been no media reports of town hall meetings like Wyoming’s, nor whispers of disused facilities being repurposed. It’s possible ICE’s need in this region might be handled by expanding use of county jails (some Utah county sheriffs do rent bed space to ICE for short-term holds). In fact, just north in Montana, ICE recently inquired about using a county jail’s extra beds (Gallatin County) for holds – a plan that was dropped due to legal concerns[kpax.com](https://www.kpax.com/news/montana-news/ice-seeks-to-use-gallatin-county-detention-center-as-holding-facility#:~:text=ICE%20seeks%20to%20use%20Gallatin,as%20a%20temporary%20holding%20facility)[kbzk.com](https://www.kbzk.com/news/local-news/gallatin-county-leaders-decide-not-to-move-forward-with-ice-detention-plan#:~:text=Gallatin%20County%20leaders%20decide%20not,to%20Drop%20ICE%20Detention%20Proposal). Similar outreach could be happening in Utah under the radar.

 

**Sabot’s approach in UT:** If Sabot Consulting identified a potential site in Utah, it remains undisclosed publicly. Sabot might have looked at **remote areas or economically struggling towns** that could see a detention center as a jobs provider (a pattern seen elsewhere). But any Utah move would likely provoke pushback from immigrant advocates and possibly run afoul of state law unless very carefully structured.

 

**Confidence:** Moderate – we know Utah was in the expansion plan[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=Sabot%20Consulting%20also%20submitted%20a,TX%2C%20previously%20used%20to%20hold), but the combination of statutory barriers and lack of public info leaves this as a _watch-and-see_. **Signals to watch:** any Utah legislative moves to amend laws on private detention (none so far in 2025), increased ICE use of Utah county jails, or quiet procurement notices. At this time, **Utah appears to be on hold** in terms of new ICE facilities – effectively a _“not now”_ due to legal roadblocks, even if ICE originally had interest.

## Montana and Idaho: Modular Plans and Community Reactions

Montana and Idaho fall under ICE’s Northwest and Northern field office planning, and while they were not primary targets like Colorado, **there have been some stirrings**:

- **Montana:** In the FOIA documents, **Active Deployment Systems**, a contractor specializing in temporary structures, proposed setting up a **“comprehensive [camp] using modular units”** for ICE detention at a site in Montana[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=the%20geographic%20boundaries%20of%20the,City%2C%20MO%3B%20and%20in%20Montana). The details are sparse – the proposal included a notional _“camp layout”_ for Montana, likely near a transportation hub (possibly Billings or elsewhere with an airport and infrastructure). No specific Montana location was named in the FOIA excerpts. However, an interesting development arose in early 2025: **Yellowstone County’s commission chairman sent a letter offering the county’s MetraPark fairgrounds in Billings as a detention site** for ICE’s use[dailymontanan.com](https://dailymontanan.com/2025/01/24/yellowstone-county-chairman-offers-metrapark-as-detaining-facility-for-immigration-crackdown/#:~:text=,to%20Congressional%20delegation%2C%20saying). This was presented as a way to assist with the federal immigration crackdown. The idea drew swift backlash from local residents and some officials. By late January, the MetraPark’s general manager publicly stated that **the venue “is not…nor is [it] planning to be used as a detention facility”**, trying to quell the uproar[dailymontanan.com](https://dailymontanan.com/2025/02/11/general-manager-says-metrapark-wont-be-used-as-a-detention-facility/#:~:text=General%20manager%20says%20MetraPark%20won%27t,used%20as%20a%20detention%20facility). Essentially, community sentiment in Billings was negative about turning a public event center into a jail for immigrants. As of June–July, there’s **no evidence that ICE has acted on any Montana site**. The Active Deployment “Montana camp” concept might have been contingent on finding a willing partner (like Yellowstone County) which now seems unlikely. **Confidence:** Moderate – we have documentation of the concept[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=the%20geographic%20boundaries%20of%20the,City%2C%20MO%3B%20and%20in%20Montana), but no action. **Red flags:** If ICE faces overflow elsewhere, Montana could resurface as an option due to its available land. Local watchdogs and media (e.g. _Daily Montanan_) are on alert, so any permit or unusual construction at fairgrounds or vacant properties would likely be noticed quickly.
    
- **Idaho:** The state of Idaho has not figured prominently in public discussions of new ICE facilities, but it’s indirectly part of the picture. ICE’s Seattle Field Office jurisdiction includes Idaho, and FOIA maps of proposed expansion in the West mention Idaho possibly as an area of interest (perhaps because Idaho has no dedicated ICE detention center, meaning detainees from Idaho are usually held out-of-state). That said, **no specific Idaho location was named in the FOIA releases**, nor have there been news reports of pitches to Idaho communities in the past month. Idaho does have a for-profit state prison (the Idaho Correctional Center, operated by CoreCivic) – theoretically ICE could contract for beds there, but that would require state cooperation which hasn’t been indicated. Moreover, Idaho’s political climate, while conservative, has not publicly lobbied for an ICE facility. **Current status:** No known permit activity or contracts in Idaho. The Mountain West expansion focus seems to have been on Colorado (Denver Field Office) and the Salt Lake City region (spilling into WY/MT) rather than Idaho itself. **Confidence:** N/A – essentially, Idaho is quiet on this front right now. We include it as a “secondary watch” state simply because if Seattle or Salt Lake ICE offices scramble for more capacity, Idaho might get pulled in. For instance, ICE could conceivably look at Mountain Home AFB or other federal properties in Idaho if desperate (pure speculation at this point). **Conclusion for Idaho:** _No news is good news_ in terms of detention infrastructure – but we continue to monitor Idaho’s local media and governmental filings for any sudden moves.
    

## Broader Indicators and Early Warnings

Aside from site-specific developments, several **cross-cutting signs** can reveal if ICE is moving from planning to action in this region:

- **Hiring and Staffing Announcements:** So far, we have _not_ seen explicit job postings for “Detention Officer – [Colorado location]” or similar that would telegraph new facilities coming online. CoreCivic’s careers page shows no current openings in Walsenburg[indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Corecivic/locations/CO/Walsenburg#:~:text=CoreCivic%20jobs%20near%20Walsenburg%2C%20CO)[indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Corecivic/locations/CO/Walsenburg#:~:text=Detention%20Officer), and GEO Group listings in Colorado Springs haven’t popped up either. If contracts get signed, a hiring blitz would follow – via job boards, hiring fairs, or even Craigslist ads for support roles (food service, maintenance, etc.). **We are watching these channels daily.** One potentially telling listing would be subcontractor jobs (e.g. a local plumbing company seeking many workers for a “remote project” or a catering company hiring en masse in a small town). None have surfaced since June 10. It’s likely the contractors are in a holding pattern until agreements are inked.
    
- **Equipment & Construction Movements:** Physical preparation of facilities might require repairs or upgrades – e.g. fixing fences at an old prison, servicing HVAC and plumbing, installing surveillance systems. Contracts for such work might be visible if they go through local approval or if workers talk. Thus far, nothing notable like a fencing contract at Hudson or an electrical permit at Huerfano has appeared in public records. **However, some work may be happening quietly:** For instance, CoreCivic could be sending internal maintenance crews to Huerfano to assess generators or dormitory conditions. The lack of permit filings suggests no major structural changes (which fits with “ready to open” claims). Similarly, the tent camp option would require a sudden influx of trucks, tents, and infrastructure – none of which has been observed. Any spike in such activity would be a red flag of imminent use.
    
- **Social Media & Community Chatter:** We’ve scanned Twitter (X), Facebook groups, and local forums. Beyond the aforementioned reactions (supportive and oppositional) in Walsenburg and Kemmerer, there haven’t been leaks like “I saw buses at [facility]” or “my company got asked to cater an ICE facility.” One exception: a user on TikTok and local news segments highlighted Walsenburg’s eagerness for ICE’s business, basically amplifying the story that the town _“welcomes the closed prison being used”_[twitter.com](https://twitter.com/KyleClark/status/1943360479880990780#:~:text=,with%20the%20politics%20and). Activist networks in Colorado (e.g. American Friends Service Committee, immigrant aid groups) are also sharing the FOIA news and gearing up to monitor these sites. We anticipate if, say, a convoy of buses or flights of detainees heads toward Colorado, these networks will blow the whistle on platforms like Threads, Twitter, or local radio. **As of July 12, that has not happened** – a crucial sign that mass transfers have not yet begun.
    
- **State/Local Government Signals:** While local governments often claim they have no role (e.g. Huerfano County’s _“no dog in the fight”_ stance[worldjournalnewspaper.com](https://worldjournalnewspaper.com/commissioners-approve-sandoz-opioid-settlement-agreement/#:~:text=Commission%20Chairman%20Karl%20Sporleder%20said,interested%20in%20a%20CoreCivic%20property)), any attempt to actually activate a facility could generate official correspondence or emergency meetings. For example, if ICE tried to open Hudson, Weld County or the Town of Hudson might need to coordinate law enforcement support or road access; if Cheyenne Mountain were activated, Colorado Springs officials might be briefed about expected detainee transport flows. Nothing of that sort has seeped out. On the contrary, we saw local authorities trying to assert some control elsewhere: a **judge in Kansas issued an injunction on June 4 to stop CoreCivic from populating a shuttered prison in Leavenworth with ICE detainees until the city’s permit requirements are met**[latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-06-16/ice-is-using-no-bid-contracts-boosting-big-firms-to-get-more-detention-beds#:~:text=A%20judge%20has%20halted%20CoreCivic,permit%20from%20frustrated%20city%20officials). That case (highlighted in a June 16 LA Times report) shows that local permitting can indeed be a battleground. In Colorado, however, the likely sites are county or privately zoned such that ICE and the prison companies believe they don’t need additional local permission. We will keep an eye on any Colorado city or county that hints at requiring use permits for these conversions. So far, none have.
    
- **Federal Contracting and Policy Moves:** Nationally, ICE is aggressively expanding via **no-bid contract extensions and awards to private firms** (often benefiting companies staffed by ex-ICE officials)[latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-06-16/ice-is-using-no-bid-contracts-boosting-big-firms-to-get-more-detention-beds#:~:text=match%20at%20L294%20existing%20agreements,ICE%20if%20someone%20is%20a). This means changes can happen without the usual paper trail of open solicitations. The Department of Homeland Security has also floated use of military bases and other federal sites to detain migrants (e.g. the mention of Buckley SFB in Colorado)[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ice-use-us-military-base-colorado-detain-migrants-2025-01-29/#:~:text=ICE%20to%20use%20U,Space%20Force%20Base%20in). Such arrangements can bypass local oversight entirely. We are tracking DHS press releases and notices: for instance, ICE’s own news releases in late June announced policy shifts like refusing to bring detainees to certain local courthouses in Colorado[cpr.org](https://www.cpr.org/2025/06/27/ice-says-it-will-stop-letting-detainees-go-to-criminal-court-in-some-colorado-counties/#:~:text=ICE%20says%20it%20will%20stop,on%20June%2027%2C%202025), which hints at more direct federal handling of detainees. The coordination between ICE ERO (Enforcement and Removal Operations) and field offices in activating new capacity is largely opaque. However, any sudden “surge operation” (mass arrest campaign) in the Mountain West would likely be preceded by securing these detention spaces. The **absence of mass raids in Colorado/Utah in the last month** indicates ICE is possibly waiting for the infrastructure to be ready.
    

## Barriers and Information Gaps

Our investigation encountered several **limitations** and areas lacking transparency:

- **Opaque Permit Data:** Many rural counties and small towns do not have easily searchable online permit databases. We relied on local news and meeting minutes (when available) to infer if construction or renovation permits were issued. It’s possible minor permits (e.g. to reconnect utilities or test systems at a closed prison) were pulled without fanfare. For example, if CoreCivic quietly applied to reinstate an occupancy permit at Huerfano County C.C., that might only appear in obscure records or not at all if previously grandfathered. **We did not find any explicit permit notices** related to the ICE sites during this period, but this could be due to lack of public disclosure rather than lack of activity. This is a red flag – things can move forward under the radar.
    
- **Redactions in FOIA Documents:** The ACLU-obtained records provided valuable insights (capacities, proposals, locations) but also had **significant redactions**. Information on “pricing and staffing challenges” and on “potential impediments” like legal or community opposition was omitted by ICE[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=lawsuit%20sought%20records%20related%20to,obtained%20via%20the%20ACLU%E2%80%99s%20litigation). Thus, we don’t know, for instance, what ICE privately noted about community attitudes in places like Hudson or what budget they have earmarked for each site. We also lack specifics on timelines – the proposals likely included target dates, which might be redacted. This makes it hard to gauge how imminent each facility’s opening is.
    
- **Limited On-the-Ground Verification:** Due to time and resource constraints, we have not physically visited these sites in the past month. Verification of whether any lights are on, contractors present, or equipment staged at, say, the Hudson prison or Cheyenne Mountain, is pending. Such verification would greatly increase confidence about activity. We are coordinating with local contacts to possibly get eyes on these facilities soon. Until then, we rely on secondary reports (and so far, locals have not reported unusual activity).
    
- **Media Silences and Focus Areas:** Local media coverage has been uneven. Colorado outlets (CPR News, Denver7, KKTV, KRDO, CBS Colorado) did cover the story when the FOIA docs came out[cpr.org](https://www.cpr.org/2025/07/10/proposed-ice-detention-facilities-colorado-aclu/#:~:text=In%20the%20wake%20of%20the,made%20the%20list%20for%20consideration)[krdo.com](https://krdo.com/news/2025/07/10/feds-eye-colorado-springs-for-two-new-ice-detention-centers/#:~:text=Federal%20documents%20obtained%20by%20the,which%20is%20northeast%20of%20Denver)[cbsnews.com](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/private-prison-companies-ice-plans-expand-colorado-detention-capacity/#:~:text=Just%20days%20after%20the%20passage,its%20lawsuit%20filed%20in%20April). However, coverage tends to rehash the proposals rather than investigate current prep work. In smaller communities like Hudson or La Junta, local newspapers either are very limited or non-existent, meaning less independent watchdogging. The Huerfano World Journal (weekly paper) gave some coverage to the commissioners’ stance[worldjournalnewspaper.com](https://worldjournalnewspaper.com/commissioners-approve-sandoz-opioid-settlement-agreement/#:~:text=Commission%20Chairman%20Karl%20Sporleder%20said,interested%20in%20a%20CoreCivic%20property), but didn’t report on any physical site activity – suggesting there may have been none noticeable, or they lacked capacity to dig deeper. In Wyoming, the coverage came mainly from _WyoFile_ (a nonprofit outlet) and was picked up by ICT and others[ictnews.org](https://ictnews.org/news/wyoming-town-leaders-balk-at-immigration-jail/#:~:text=Last%20week%2C%20a%20company%20called,Immigrations%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement), but after the proposal was killed, the story went quiet. In Montana, _Daily Montanan_ covered the MetraPark controversy in January[dailymontanan.com](https://dailymontanan.com/2025/01/24/yellowstone-county-chairman-offers-metrapark-as-detaining-facility-for-immigration-crackdown/#:~:text=,to%20Congressional%20delegation%2C%20saying) and follow-ups[dailymontanan.com](https://dailymontanan.com/2025/02/11/general-manager-says-metrapark-wont-be-used-as-a-detention-facility/#:~:text=General%20manager%20says%20MetraPark%20won%27t,used%20as%20a%20detention%20facility), but since then no news – if the county commissioners are discussing other options, it hasn’t surfaced. **Bottom line:** We might be missing developments simply because they aren’t being reported or are being kept discreet.
    
- **Community Access:** Some information might only be accessible via FOIA or direct requests – for example, contracts between ICE and a private company won’t be public until after award (if at all, given DHS secrecy). We intend to follow up with FOIA requests for any contracts signed for these sites, but that’s a longer-term effort. Additionally, minutes from city council or county commissioner meetings sometimes lag in posting. We checked all available through early July, but new meetings (e.g. mid-July) might bring something up.
    
- **Social Media and Rumor Verification:** While we did monitor social channels, we treat unverified claims with caution. We did not encounter any specific rumors like “50 new jobs posted in La Junta” or “convoy seen near Hudson” – which is somewhat reassuring. However, one must consider that ICE and its contractors might intentionally stage operations at odd hours or through less visible means (e.g. flying detainees into smaller airports, or using unmarked buses). Without tipsters on the ground, those could be missed initially.
    

In conclusion, **the lack of overt activity in the last month should not be mistaken for inactivity behind the scenes**. The pieces are in place: contracts are likely to be executed under expedited authorities, and multiple Mountain West facilities are on standby. The period from June 10 to July 12, 2025, appears to have been a preparatory and negotiation phase, **without actual detainee transfers or construction** – essentially a quiet before the storm. We have identified the critical sites (especially in Colorado) and the early signals (FOIA docs, local government positions, etc.). Going forward, the next indicators of escalation will be: sudden recruitment drives, physical refurbishment projects, and transportation of migrants into these states. All of these could unfold very quickly if an enforcement action (such as a **mass arrest “surge” or family border transfer) is ordered. We will continue to monitor all channels so that the moment planning turns into practice in the Mountain West, it will be detected and reported.
