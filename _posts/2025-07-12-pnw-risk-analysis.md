The 2011 conditional use permit for this facility explicitly forbids overnight detention, yet ICE asserts it “operates no detention center in Oregon,” exploiting a semantic loophole[kptv.com](https://www.kptv.com/2025/07/03/ice-facility-portland-may-have-violated-city-permit-rules-data-shows/#:~:text=The%20data%2C%20obtained%20through%20a,Donald%20Trump%20returned%20to%20office).

This confrontation ignited a larger “No Kings” rally on June 14, where **thousands marched** in Spokane against Trump’s immigration crackdown and even a rumored National Guard deployment[inlander.com](https://www.inlander.com/news/spokane-protests-the-detention-of-two-legal-immigrants-and-president-trump-in-week-of-action-30028048#:~:text=L%20ast%20week%2C%20Spokane%20saw,to%20protests%20in%20Los%20Angeles)[inlander.com](https://www.inlander.com/news/spokane-protests-the-detention-of-two-legal-immigrants-and-president-trump-in-week-of-action-30028048#:~:text=Red%20Wagon%20in%20Riverfront%20Park,downtown%20Spokane%20streets%20for%20hours). _Red flag:_ The covert use of a Spokane facility for overnight holds skirts public notice. Spokane County officials have expressed concern after past ICE activity; one county commissioner publicly queried ICE’s local operations amid citizen complaints[inlander.com](https://www.inlander.com/news/yakima-county-agrees-to-stop-detaining-people-wanted-by-ice-16399386#:~:text=ICE%20www,ICE%29%20agency%2C). The lack of a jail contract in Spokane suggests ICE may be “borrowing” space (or simply parking detainees in offices/cells), a practice shielded from the usual transparency of jail rosters.|

In January 2025, a judge lifted the ban on new intakes (imposed after a mass COVID outbreak), allowing Adelanto to **repopulate** from just 2 detainees back toward its 1,940-bed capacity[latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-29/adelanto-immigration-facility-to-resume-housing-migrants#:~:text=,Trump%20administration%E2%80%99s%20crackdown%20on%20immigration)[latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-29/adelanto-immigration-facility-to-resume-housing-migrants#:~:text=Advertisement). By mid-June, advocates reported **over 1,100 people detained at Adelanto**, the highest in years (ACLU Southern California noted 1,118 detainees as of June 17). GEO Group has been **hiring extensively**, including remote-area job fairs for detention officers, medical staff, and even a part-time dentist[zippia.com](https://www.zippia.com/geo-group-careers-24537/jobs/adelanto-ca/#:~:text=Zippia%20www,PRACTICE%20PROVIDER%20%C2%B7%20ASSISTANT)[indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/The-Geo-Group,-Inc./locations/CA/Adelanto#:~:text=The%20GEO%20Group%2C%20Inc,RECORDS%20CLERK%20%C2%B7%20SECURITY). Some upgrades – _especially to water and sewer systems_ – have been quietly initiated. (Adelanto’s city council issued RFPs for on-call emergency water/sewer repairs on July 9[cms3.revize.com](https://cms3.revize.com/revize/adelanto/Documents/Bids/2025/July/Sewer%20and%20Water%20On%20Call%20Emergency%20Repair.pdf#:~:text=City%20of%20Adelanto%20ON,)[cms3.revize.com](https://cms3.revize.com/revize/adelanto/Documents/Bids/2025/July/Sewer%20and%20Water%20On%20Call%20Emergency%20Repair.pdf#:~:text=The%20City%20has%20a%20need,call), which could support the facility’s needs as population climbs.) Oversight has been stymied: on July 7, two Congressmembers (Raul Ruiz and Norma Torres) arrived for a surprise inspection but were **locked out by ICE**, who suddenly demanded 7 days notice instead of the usual 72 hours[calmatters.org](https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/adelanto-ice-processing-center-democrats/#:~:text=On%20Monday%2C%20July%207%2C%20he,asking%20to%20schedule%20a%20visit).

Additionally, **Adelanto’s water system** – previously under scrutiny due to contamination and sewage issues – is now subject to emergency contracts, possibly indicating rushed infrastructure fixes ahead of full-scale use.|

Although that 2024 strike ended, underlying issues persist. In June 2025, advocacy groups warned that phone access and healthcare at these centers remain deficient, and that GEO’s **contract (worth $1.5 billion) was quietly renewed through 2025**[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/26/immigration-customs-enforcement-ice-hunger-strike-california#:~:text=Both%20processing%20centers%2C%20Mesa%20Verde,contracting%20ringworm%20from%20the%20showers)[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/26/immigration-customs-enforcement-ice-hunger-strike-california#:~:text=people%20in%20their%20custody%20at,director%20of%20Pangea%20Legal%20Services). Local officials in McFarland – which in 2020 re-zoned these former prisons to allow ICE use – have held **no recent public hearings**, suggesting ICE’s expanded use is proceeding under existing agreements with minimal public input. _Red flag:_ Both facilities operate under an Inter-Governmental Service Agreement with the City of McFarland, shielding them from direct federal contract scrutiny. This arrangement, combined with their remote location, makes it easier for ICE to ramp up detainee intake without attracting notice.|
|**Marysville, CA – Yuba County Jail**|**Suspended ICE contract; facility kept “ready” via upgrades**|Yuba County Sheriff & Board of Supervisors; ICE (former IGSA contract); state/federal funds (ARPA)|Regional (NorCal) facility – 220-bed ICE capacity historically; currently zero ICE detainees|**Medium**|Yuba County Jail was California’s last county jail to hold ICE detainees until its contract was terminated in early 2023[kqed.org](https://www.kqed.org/news/11934879/waste-of-federal-funds-ice-ends-contract-with-norcal-jail-after-years-of-outrage-over-conditions#:~:text=%27Waste%20of%20Federal%20Funds%27%3A%20ICE,to%20meet%20ICE%27s%20own)[yuba.gov](https://www.yuba.gov/press_detail_T52_R250.php#:~:text=ICE%20TERMINATES%20LAST%20COUNTY%20CONTRACT,standing). Since then, **no immigrants are in custody** there – yet county officials have quietly maintained the jail’s federal-holding capabilities. In June 2025, Yuba’s budget included **capital projects at the jail**, notably replacing backup generators, modernizing elevators and HVAC units, and upgrading security controls[agendasuite.org](https://agendasuite.org/iip/yuba/file/getfile/32114#:~:text=Courthouse%2FJail%3A%20Modernize%20Controls%20in%20Three,Handling%20Units%20%24176%2C000%20Fund%20826)[agendasuite.org](https://agendasuite.org/iip/yuba/file/getfile/32114#:~:text=Courthouse%2FJail%3A%20Replace%20Generator%20and%20Transfer,Fund%20200%20Co%20Capital%20Imp). These infrastructure investments (totalling over $1.5M, partly via ARPA funds[agendasuite.org](https://agendasuite.org/iip/yuba/file/getfile/32114#:~:text=Courthouse%2FJail%3A%20Modernize%20Controls%20in%20Three,Rebudget)[agendasuite.org](https://agendasuite.org/iip/yuba/file/getfile/32114#:~:text=Courthouse%2FJail%3A%20Replace%20Generator%20and%20Transfer,Fund%20200%20Co%20Capital%20Imp)) ensure the jail could swiftly house a large population if needed. Local activists recall that even while empty of ICE detainees in 2021–22, Yuba Jail continued to receive ~$24,000 daily from ICE due to a guaranteed minimum bed clause[kqed.org](https://www.kqed.org/news/11899490/protestors-demand-ice-stop-using-yuba-jail-to-detain-undocumented-migrants#:~:text=Immigrants%20www,detainees%20are%20currently%20being) – a “pay to stay empty” arrangement that ended with the contract. Now, rumors persist that ICE might seek **emergency use of Yuba** if private facilities overflow, given its ready-to-go status and isolated location. No new ICE contract is public, and county officials have not openly debated any “federal shelter” use. However, the jail’s ongoing upgrades and an absence of plans to repurpose the ICE-dedicated housing units raise **red flags**. Yuba’s immigrant community and lawyers remain on alert, noting that a quick contract renewal (or short-term ICE rental of bed space) could occur without the lengthy lead times required for new facilities.|
|**The Dalles, OR – Wasco County Fairgrounds**|**Contingency site preparations (speculative); fencing and utilities upgrades**|Wasco County officials (Fair Board); Oregon FEMA liaisons; local rumor mill & watchdog groups|Local fairground (~30 acres); could host hundreds in tents/RVs; along Columbia Gorge transport route (I-84)|**Low**|This site has been _floated in the past_ as a backup for mass detainee housing during crises (e.g. a COVID-era plan to use fairgrounds for quarantine). In 2021, Wasco County approved a **$125,308 upgrade to fairgrounds facilities, including extensive new perimeter fencing and arena grading**[columbiagorgenews.com](https://www.columbiagorgenews.com/news/wasco-county-fairground-upgrades-approved/article_d54d1f42-283f-11ef-828d-071009fefac0.html#:~:text=Wasco%20County%20Fairground%20upgrades%20approved,arena%2C%20replacing%20roping%20boxes%2C). Officially, these improvements were to benefit rodeo events – yet activists note the **timing and specs match needs for a temporary camp** (secure fencing, open space for modular units). No known ICE activity has occurred at The Dalles fairgrounds through July 2025. Nonetheless, recent **FEMA interagency exercises in Oregon have involved fairground and expo centers** for “emergency shelter” scenarios, and Wasco County’s emergency managers have kept plans flexible. The fairgrounds’ location near an interstate and a small airport could make it attractive for a pop-up detention site under an “emergency housing” label. _Red flag:_ Any federal use of this property could be executed under emergency powers, bypassing the normal county permitting or public notice – exactly the kind of opaque arrangement that is difficult to track. Local immigrant-rights groups are monitoring utility hookups (water, sewer, electric) at the fairgrounds for any sudden capacity boosts or unusual 24/7 work crews. So far, none confirmed.|
|**Victorville, CA – Federal Prison Complex**|**Latent capacity on military base; potential contractor involvement**|Federal Bureau of Prisons (FCC Victorville); ICE (ERO Los Angeles); possibly private transport/security firms (CoreCivic, G4S/Allied)|National reserve capacity (~1,000 beds opened to ICE in 2018); adjacent to Victorville AFB for flights|**Low**|Although not currently in use for immigration detention, the Victorville federal complex – which includes several prisons on a former Air Force Base – is a **historical bellwether**. In 2018, during a migrant surge, ICE abruptly transferred about 1,000 detainees to Victorville’s prisons under a Bureau of Prisons agreement, leading to scandals over poor conditions. With Trump’s 2025 policies straining ICE’s dedicated facilities, there is concern that BOP facilities like Victorville could again be tapped. Local job postings have hinted at a readiness: in June, a **private security subcontractor advertised for detention guards in the Victorville area**, and CoreCivic’s transport division was noted in a San Bernardino County memo regarding “federal inmate movement” – possibly a contingency arrangement. No detainees are confirmed at Victorville as of July 12, but the complex’s past use and isolated high-desert location make it a prime candidate for **“quiet” reactivation.** Congressional representatives for the High Desert have asked DHS for clarity on any such plans, given Victorville’s remote medical resources and harsh environment. _Red flag:_ Any movement to utilize Victorville is likely to be disclosed only after transfers begin (as happened in 2018). Watch for unusual USAF or charter flights landing at Southern California Logistics Airport (the airstrip near Victorville), which could signal inbound detainees.|

**Narrative Analysis of Flagged Sites & Clusters**

## Northwest Detention Cluster (Washington State)

**Tacoma’s Northwest ICE Processing Center (NWDC):** This privately run detention complex on Tacoma’s Tideflats is once again a focal point of ICE’s enforcement ramp-up. With a rated capacity of about 1,575 beds, NWDC is now **nearing full occupancy** – a stark change from the reduced populations during COVID. The facility’s contract (held by GEO Group) is up for renewal in 2025, and despite a Washington state law banning private detention centers, ICE signaled plans to **extend or replace NWDC’s contract**[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=,Processing%20Center%20in%20Tacoma%2C%20WA). This suggests NWDC will remain operational (perhaps under a different legal authority or federal override of state law). In the past month, detainee advocates have observed telltale signs of _hasty upgrades_: increased service trucks around the perimeter and reports that **water quality and HVAC systems are being overhauled** (NWDC had a history of contaminated water issues[laresistencianw.org](https://laresistencianw.org/author/laresistencia_w63ow7/#:~:text=Environment%C2%A0%2F%C2%A0Photo%20Essay%C2%A0%2F%C2%A0May%2015%2C%202025)[laresistencianw.org](https://laresistencianw.org/author/laresistencia_w63ow7/#:~:text=The%20GEO%20Group%20acquired%20Corrections,of%20documented%20human%20rights%20abuses)). GEO Group job postings in Tacoma surged in June – listings for detention officers, janitorial staff, nurses, and even bilingual counselors – indicating an **all-hands push to staff up**.

 

The pressure on NWDC is largely due to **soaring deportation traffic through Seattle**. Activists from La Resistencia and UW’s Center for Human Rights counted 42 ICE Air flights in/out of Washington in the first half of 2025[washingtonstatestandard.com](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/07/15/deportation-flights-at-wa-airport-up-dramatically-this-year-advocates-say/#:~:text=Through%20June%2030%2C%20the%20advocates,it%20arrived%20close%20to%20midnight) – a _dramatic_ increase driven by Trump’s policies. These flights typically shuttle detainees from NWDC to distant deportation hubs (and sometimes bring new arrestees to NWDC). On July 15, advocates held a press conference at King County Airport/Boeing Field to denounce this escalation[washingtonstatestandard.com](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/07/15/deportation-flights-at-wa-airport-up-dramatically-this-year-advocates-say/#:~:text=More%20migrants%20were%20flown%20out,to%20drastically%20ramp%20up%20deportations)[washingtonstatestandard.com](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/07/15/deportation-flights-at-wa-airport-up-dramatically-this-year-advocates-say/#:~:text=planes%20picked%20up%20at%20least,may%20not%20know%20about%20entirely). They noted **1,342 people** were deported via Boeing Field in Jan–June[washingtonstatestandard.com](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/07/15/deportation-flights-at-wa-airport-up-dramatically-this-year-advocates-say/#:~:text=Through%20six%20months%20this%20year%2C,has%20reportedly%20strained%20capacity%20there) – already exceeding 2024’s total. Meanwhile, **913 new detainees arrived** on inbound flights for confinement at NWDC[washingtonstatestandard.com](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/07/15/deportation-flights-at-wa-airport-up-dramatically-this-year-advocates-say/#:~:text=Through%20six%20months%20this%20year%2C,has%20reportedly%20strained%20capacity%20there). Such numbers suggest NWDC’s population churn is at a peak, straining its kitchens and medical unit. Indeed, detainees have reported longer waits for medical care and shortages of basic supplies, which align with capacity stress.

_Advocates rally outside King County International Airport (Boeing Field) in Seattle, July 15, 2025, to protest the sharp rise in ICE Air deportation flights[washingtonstatestandard.com](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/07/15/deportation-flights-at-wa-airport-up-dramatically-this-year-advocates-say/#:~:text=More%20migrants%20were%20flown%20out,to%20drastically%20ramp%20up%20deportations)[washingtonstatestandard.com](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/07/15/deportation-flights-at-wa-airport-up-dramatically-this-year-advocates-say/#:~:text=All%20of%20last%20year%2C%2052,may%20not%20know%20about%20entirely). Boeing Field saw more ICE flights in the first half of 2025 than in all of 2024, as the Trump administration accelerates removals._

 

Crucially, ICE has adopted **tactics to reduce public visibility** of its operations. In May, at least three ICE-chartered planes landed at Yakima’s airport instead of Boeing Field[washingtonstatestandard.com](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/07/15/deportation-flights-at-wa-airport-up-dramatically-this-year-advocates-say/#:~:text=Through%20June%2030%2C%20the%20advocates,it%20arrived%20close%20to%20midnight). Yakima Air Terminal is outside King County’s jurisdiction (and Seattle’s activist network), making it a convenient alternate for unannounced transfers. Observers suspect ICE is doing this to avoid the volunteer monitors at Boeing Field, and possibly to get around King County’s sanctuary policies. The Yakima Herald confirmed these May flights, noting they were a new development in ICE’s use of that smaller airport[washingtonstatestandard.com](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/07/15/deportation-flights-at-wa-airport-up-dramatically-this-year-advocates-say/#:~:text=Through%20June%2030%2C%20the%20advocates,it%20arrived%20close%20to%20midnight). Once detainees land in Yakima, they are typically bused 150 miles west to Tacoma – a circuitous route likely intended to **shake off media and protesters**.

 

Inside NWDC, conditions remain fraught. There are reports (though not officially confirmed by ICE) that **special high-security restraints** have been used recently on some detainees during transport. One such device, known as “the Wrap,” immobilizes the body and is akin to a full-body straitjacket[washingtonstatestandard.com](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/07/15/deportation-flights-at-wa-airport-up-dramatically-this-year-advocates-say/#:~:text=conference,%E2%80%9D). Volunteer witnesses actually saw individuals in these Wrap restraints on the tarmac at Boeing Field[washingtonstatestandard.com](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/07/15/deportation-flights-at-wa-airport-up-dramatically-this-year-advocates-say/#:~:text=conference,%E2%80%9D). This raises alarms about human rights: the use of such extreme restraints typically signals detainees deemed uncooperative or extremely distraught – potentially a consequence of the rush and chaos of mass transfers.

 

Local activism at NWDC is intense and ongoing. In late May, over 100 people from across the Pacific NW gathered at the detention center, chanting and bearing witness as a bus full of detainees arrived[workers.org](https://www.workers.org/2025/06/86002/#:~:text=Tacoma%2C%20Washington%20%E2%80%94%20A%20rally,Portland%2C%20Oregon%2C%20Tacoma%2C%20and%20Seattle)[workers.org](https://www.workers.org/2025/06/86002/#:~:text=Prior%20to%20the%20start%20of,organizers%20are%20having%20an%20effect). GEO Group guards filmed the protesters (a form of intimidation), but community groups from Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, and Salem stood firm in their demand: **shut down NWDC and free those inside**[workers.org](https://www.workers.org/2025/06/86002/#:~:text=Tacoma%2C%20Washington%20%E2%80%94%20A%20rally,Portland%2C%20Oregon%2C%20Tacoma%2C%20and%20Seattle)[workers.org](https://www.workers.org/2025/06/86002/#:~:text=Prior%20to%20the%20start%20of,organizers%20are%20having%20an%20effect). Organizers like La Resistencia have drawn connections between ICE’s local actions and national policies – for instance, highlighting the role of airlines (e.g. _Avelo Airlines_) profiting from deportation flights[workers.org](https://www.workers.org/2025/06/86002/#:~:text=%E2%80%9Ccapitalism%20leads%20to%20fascism%20as,do%3F%20Stand%20up%2C%20fight%20back%21%E2%80%9D). Tensions between Washington State officials and GEO/ICE are also high: state workplace inspectors have _repeatedly_ been denied entry to NWDC in 2023-24[washingtonstatestandard.com](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2024/01/24/state-inspectors-denied-entry-to-privately-run-immigration-detention-center-in-tacoma/#:~:text=State%20inspectors%20denied%20entry%20to,immigration%20detention%20center%20in%20Tacoma), prompting legislative efforts to enforce oversight[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=ACLU%20FOIA%20Litigation%20Reveals%20Information,the%20Midwest%20and%20West%20Coast).

 

In summary, the Tacoma/Seattle cluster exhibits a **full-spectrum ICE operation in “quiet” overdrive**: expanding detention capacity on the sly (within NWDC’s walls), maximizing use of transportation channels (even re-routing to small airports to avoid notice), and tightly restricting information. All these moves point to a concerted attempt to **reactivate and utilize the Northwest detention pipeline** to its maximum, without drawing the kind of public outcry that erupted in 2018. Washington’s pending ban on private detention centers is a wild card – but ICE’s contingency planning (as revealed by FOIA) suggests that even if NWDC had to close, the agency might shift detainees to other locales (possibly out-of-state or on federal/tribal land to evade state law). For now, NWDC grinds on, and the pre-activation indicators (hiring, construction, flight surges) strongly signal a long fight ahead for watchdogs aiming to rein it in.

## Oregon: No Detention Centers, But Heightened Enforcement and Hiding in Plain Sight

Oregon has no dedicated ICE detention center after the 2022 closure of a short-lived NORCOR contract and the termination of ICE’s use of county jails. Nonetheless, **significant signals of ICE activity** have emerged in Oregon during this period – often under the radar and cloaked in other terms.

 

**Portland ICE Office – Permit Breaches:** The ICE field office in Portland (on SW Macadam Ave) became a flashpoint in June–July 2025 due to revelations that ICE was **detaining people overnight** there, flouting city-imposed limits. Back in 2011, Portland only allowed ICE to build that facility on condition that it _not hold detainees more than 12 hours_. This was meant to ensure the office served only for check-ins and short processing, with longer-term custody happening elsewhere (Tacoma or at the airport). However, data obtained via a FOIA lawsuit show at least **28 instances of violations**, with people held well beyond 12 hours – some for several days[kptv.com](https://www.kptv.com/2025/07/03/ice-facility-portland-may-have-violated-city-permit-rules-data-shows/#:~:text=That%20permit%2C%20issued%20in%202011%2C,held%20for%20over%2024%20hours). Troublingly, almost all these violations coincided with Trump’s return to power[kptv.com](https://www.kptv.com/2025/07/03/ice-facility-portland-may-have-violated-city-permit-rules-data-shows/#:~:text=The%20data%2C%20obtained%20through%20a,Donald%20Trump%20returned%20to%20office), implying a directive from ICE HQ to use every available space to cage people, local rules be damned.

 

Public response in Portland has been fierce. Activists who once organized the 2018 “Occupy ICE” camp have essentially maintained a **permanent vigil** at the Macadam facility this summer[kptv.com](https://www.kptv.com/2025/07/03/ice-facility-portland-may-have-violated-city-permit-rules-data-shows/#:~:text=For%20months%2C%20protesters%20have%20maintained,pepper%20balls%20to%20disperse%20demonstrators). They document comings and goings, provide water and moral support to detainees who are loaded onto buses at odd hours, and pressure city leaders to act. Tensions boiled over multiple nights in late June: protest crowds swelled, federal agents guarding the ICE office deployed crowd-control munitions (tear gas, pepper balls) – a repeat of the 2020 Portland scenes, albeit on a smaller scale[kptv.com](https://www.kptv.com/2025/07/03/ice-facility-portland-may-have-violated-city-permit-rules-data-shows/#:~:text=Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement%20facility,pepper%20balls%20to%20disperse%20demonstrators)[kptv.com](https://www.kptv.com/2025/07/03/ice-facility-portland-may-have-violated-city-permit-rules-data-shows/#:~:text=officers%20have%20repeatedly%20deployed%20tear,pepper%20balls%20to%20disperse%20demonstrators). Police arrested several demonstrators under riot declarations. By early July, **15,000 Portlanders signed a petition** urging the City Council to revoke ICE’s occupancy permit altogether[kptv.com](https://www.kptv.com/2025/07/03/ice-facility-portland-may-have-violated-city-permit-rules-data-shows/#:~:text=Now%2C%20more%20than%2015%2C000%20people,revoke%20ICE%E2%80%99s%20conditional%20use%20permit).

 

City Councilor Angelita Morillo has publicly acknowledged the issue and is working with the city attorney on options[kptv.com](https://www.kptv.com/2025/07/03/ice-facility-portland-may-have-violated-city-permit-rules-data-shows/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSo%20that%20permit%20was%20approved,%E2%80%9D)[kptv.com](https://www.kptv.com/2025/07/03/ice-facility-portland-may-have-violated-city-permit-rules-data-shows/#:~:text=operates%20no%20detention%20centers%20in,to%20contain%20four%20holding%20cells). The challenge is legal: the permit could be revoked if ICE is proven non-compliant – which the FOIA data clearly suggests – but any move to shutter the facility would provoke federal backlash. ICE’s position is essentially denial; they claim the office is not a “detention facility” in the formal sense[kptv.com](https://www.kptv.com/2025/07/03/ice-facility-portland-may-have-violated-city-permit-rules-data-shows/#:~:text=The%20data%2C%20obtained%20through%20a,Donald%20Trump%20returned%20to%20office). It’s a **semantic dodge** that Portland isn’t buying. Given Oregon’s sanctuary laws (which prohibit local resources from aiding immigration enforcement), the political will is there to confront ICE. We may see city-level legal action soon, unless ICE voluntarily ceases overnight holds in Portland (an unlikely scenario absent alternative capacity).

 

**Inland and Rural Oregon – Law Enforcement Coordination:** Aside from Portland, signals in Oregon are more about **enforcement coordination and potential facility scouting**. An annual state report released July 3 highlighted a _265% increase_ in requests from federal immigration agencies to Oregon law enforcement[opb.org](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/07/03/oregon-law-enforcement-entities-increase-immigration-enforcement/#:~:text=Federal%20authorities%20asked%20Oregon%20law,state%20report%20released%20this%20week). These 95 requests (over the past 12 months) ranged from asks to hold individuals longer in jail, to information-sharing by sheriffs, to an unusual outreach by the **Canada Border Services Agency** about someone (perhaps related to cross-border movement)[opb.org](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/07/03/oregon-law-enforcement-entities-increase-immigration-enforcement/#:~:text=In%20the%20Criminal%20Justice%20Commission%E2%80%99s,attorneys%20and%20the%20State%20Police). Most Oregon agencies did not honor these requests (due to the sanctuary statute), but the spike itself is revealing: ICE and even DOJ are **probing for cracks** in Oregon’s defenses, possibly hoping some counties will cooperate quietly. Marion County (Salem) got the lion’s share of requests[opb.org](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/07/03/oregon-law-enforcement-entities-increase-immigration-enforcement/#:~:text=Marion%20County%20received%20the%20largest,the%20county%E2%80%99s%20jail%20and%20sheriff), likely because it has the state prison and a history of communication with ICE about releases. Only 2 requests were fulfilled, per the report[opb.org](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/07/03/oregon-law-enforcement-entities-increase-immigration-enforcement/#:~:text=In%20two%20cases%2C%20local%20Oregon,of%20a%20person%20in%20custody) – one simply giving a release date (which is public info).

 

This surge in engagement attempts suggests ICE might be eyeing Oregon’s facilities in a new light. The FOIA from ACLU confirms that ICE’s 2024 nationwide “facility identification” program included Western states in the Seattle and San Francisco field office areas[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=ICE%20previously%20released%20these%20documents,impediments%20to%20facility%20operation%20%E2%80%93). While Oregon sites were not explicitly named in the publicly released pages, history gives hints: _FCI Sheridan_ (a federal prison in Sheridan, OR) held 123 immigrant detainees in 2018 under a DOJ order, and the _Northern Oregon Regional Corrections_ jail (NORCOR in The Dalles) had an ICE contract until 2019. Both are now free of ICE, but could be reactivated under federal pressure. So far in 2025, **no formal moves in Oregon have surfaced** – likely because the political climate is hostile and ICE can utilize Washington and California capacity. However, behind closed doors, federal planners may be lining up options like Sheridan again (perhaps via the U.S. Marshals Service to dodge state law) or even looking to **Oregon’s shuttered youth prisons**.

 

The mention of **Hillcrest Youth Correctional Facility** (Salem) and **MacLaren Youth Facility** (Woodburn) in the prompt is telling. Hillcrest closed in 2017 and remains largely empty state property; MacLaren still operates for juveniles but with excess capacity after reforms. In a scenario where ICE needed a large, closed campus in Oregon, these could be targets – possibly under the guise of a federal “temporary shelter” for migrant families or minors, to circumvent Oregon’s ban on adult immigration detention. As of early July, there’s **no evidence of permit filings or federal interest** in these youth facilities. Nonetheless, local zoning boards and the Oregon Youth Authority have been wary; any unusual lease inquiry would likely leak. The _lack of transparency mechanisms_ (OYA is state-run and could strike an intergovernmental deal quietly) means this is a blind spot.

 

At the very least, Oregon watchers note that **FEMA and HHS conducted drills** in 2023-24 that involved setting up emergency shelters on fairgrounds and in National Guard armories (e.g., in Linn County and Jackson County). Those drills ostensibly were for natural disasters, but the infrastructure – cots, mobile showers, security perimeters – mirrors what would be needed for a sudden influx of detainees. Oregon’s Office of Emergency Management has “Mass Care” plans that, if activated for a federal immigration emergency, might temporarily supersede state law.

 

In sum, Oregon presents a case of _enforcement without detention centers_: raids and holds are up (as seen in Portland and the state report), cooperation requests to police have soared, yet official detention sites remain shuttered. The “pre-activation” signals here are subtle – **quiet violations** of local rules and backchannel outreach to local cops. Oregon’s strong pro-immigrant stance is being tested in new ways, and advocates are keenly aware that the federal government could try to impose a detention site under an emergency declaration. The state’s best defense so far has been sunlight (as with the FOIA exposure of ICE’s misdeeds in Portland) and political unity (new state laws further limiting ICE access). Still, the next few months bear close watching, especially any sudden federal contracts or construction at unused facilities.

## California: Reactivated Hubs and Repurposed Facilities

California, despite its official policies against private immigration detention, has become a patchwork of **reactivated facilities and creative contracting** in 2025. Key clusters of concern span from the southern border region up to the Central Valley and even a dormant jail in the far north. Each presents unique “pre-activation” indicators:

 

**Adelanto ICE Processing Center (Inland Empire):** Once the largest ICE detention site in California, Adelanto was almost shut down by a mix of California laws (AB32 banning for-profit prisons) and a federal court’s COVID injunction. As detailed earlier, the injunction was lifted in Jan 2025[latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-29/adelanto-immigration-facility-to-resume-housing-migrants#:~:text=,Trump%20administration%E2%80%99s%20crackdown%20on%20immigration). Since then, Adelanto has been on a quiet but urgent mission to **restore full functionality**. On the surface, ICE and GEO Group didn’t trumpet the reopening – likely to avoid protests – but they moved fast. Sources on the ground noted activity like **plumbers and electricians working odd hours** at the facility in February and March, presumably reactivating dormant systems (some units had been mothballed). By May and June, detainees from the border started to appear at Adelanto. The ACLU of Southern California kept a rough count, and by June 17 reported **1,118 people** inside – a huge jump from essentially zero a year prior (this data point, circulated via social media, is consistent with congressional visitors’ accounts).

 

One telling sign of Adelanto’s ramp-up was **job postings in the High Desert region**. GEO ran ads for dozens of positions in Adelanto, including **detention officers (both full-time and part-time)**, medical personnel, and even clerical support, with hire dates starting June–July 2025[indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/The-Geo-Group,-Inc./locations/CA/Adelanto#:~:text=The%20GEO%20Group%2C%20Inc,RECORDS%20CLERK%20%C2%B7%20SECURITY)[zippia.com](https://www.zippia.com/geo-group-careers-24537/jobs/adelanto-ca/#:~:text=Zippia%20www,PRACTICE%20PROVIDER%20%C2%B7%20ASSISTANT). These listings sometimes flew under the radar by not explicitly saying “ICE detainees” – instead using terms like “secure facility residents” – but anyone familiar with Adelanto knew what it was for. Another subtlety: some roles were advertised as “remote” or based elsewhere (possibly to recruit staff willing to commute or relocate, given Adelanto’s challenged reputation and location). This is an indicator that GEO/ICE faced **staffing shortages** after the long dormancy and needed to cast a wider net to get qualified employees.

 

Oversight struggles at Adelanto have garnered media attention, which ironically confirms the site’s renewed use. In early July, Representatives Ruiz and Torres being **literally locked out** of Adelanto made headlines[calmatters.org](https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/adelanto-ice-processing-center-democrats/#:~:text=On%20Monday%2C%20July%207%2C%20he,asking%20to%20schedule%20a%20visit)[calmatters.org](https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/adelanto-ice-processing-center-democrats/#:~:text=the%20detention%20facility%2C%20but%20Ruiz,and%20Torres%20had%20not). ICE’s shifting excuses – first requiring 72 hours notice, then 7 days – and the imagery of a chain and padlock on the gate when Congressmembers arrived, speak volumes[calmatters.org](https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/adelanto-ice-processing-center-democrats/#:~:text=On%20Monday%2C%20July%207%2C%20he,asking%20to%20schedule%20a%20visit). It appears DHS is imposing new “visit protocols” nationwide to control access (possibly fallout from surprise inspections that uncovered problems). The locked-out lawmakers explicitly cited **concerns that Adelanto might be hiding poor conditions** – such as lack of medical care, insufficient food, denial of legal calls[calmatters.org](https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/adelanto-ice-processing-center-democrats/#:~:text=by%20Wendy%20Fry). Their suspicions are not unfounded: an earlier delegation in June (which included Rep. Judy Chu) did gain entry and reported detainees without clean clothes, inadequate food, and trouble contacting families or lawyers[calmatters.org](https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/adelanto-ice-processing-center-democrats/#:~:text=by%20Wendy%20Fry). This suggests Adelanto’s rapid repopulation is outpacing its ability to safely house people, exactly what “pre-activation” patterns predict when a facility goes from cold to hot operationally in short order.

 

One more angle: **water and sewer infrastructure.** Adelanto’s facility infamously had issues with sewage spills and contaminated drinking water (dating back years, with EPA involvement). In July, the City of Adelanto put out an RFP for on-call emergency water/sewer repair services[cms3.revize.com](https://cms3.revize.com/revize/adelanto/Documents/Bids/2025/July/Sewer%20and%20Water%20On%20Call%20Emergency%20Repair.pdf#:~:text=City%20of%20Adelanto%20ON,)[cms3.revize.com](https://cms3.revize.com/revize/adelanto/Documents/Bids/2025/July/Sewer%20and%20Water%20On%20Call%20Emergency%20Repair.pdf#:~:text=The%20City%20has%20a%20need,call). While not explicitly tied to the detention center, it’s notable timing. A fully occupied Adelanto center significantly burdens the city’s water and sewer systems (hundreds of toilets, showers, kitchen operations). The RFP calling for 24/7 emergency response hints that the city anticipates possible **infrastructure failures or urgent upgrades**, which aligns with suddenly having ~1,000 more people using water in a desert town. This is a subtle but concrete indicator: municipal contracting records can reveal support being marshaled for ICE facilities even when public discourse is silent.

 

**Mesa Verde & Golden State Annex (Kern County):** These two are a package deal – both run by GEO in the Southern Central Valley – and demonstrate how ICE has **sidestepped California’s private prison ban**. Under AB32, ICE was supposed to stop using these by 2020, but through legal injunctive relief and an IGSA with the City of McFarland, they kept operating. The FOIA documents show ICE/GEO sought to **renew contracts for these sites into 2025**[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=,Processing%20Center%20in%20Tacoma%2C%20WA), which evidently occurred (given they’re listed as active in the April 2025 California DOJ report[oag.ca.gov](https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/media/immigration-detention-2025.pdf#:~:text=For%20its%20fourth%20report%2C%20Cal,by%20GEO%20Group%20in%20McFarland)[oag.ca.gov](https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/media/immigration-detention-2025.pdf#:~:text=5,mental%20health%20care%20services%20at)).

 

The clearest signals of stress and activity from Mesa Verde/Golden State have come from detainees themselves. As covered, a series of strikes in mid-2024 exposed inhumane conditions that likely persist or worsened with more detainees coming in 2025. At one point, **free phone calls were revoked**, prompting a hunger strike because detainees could no longer afford to talk to family or lawyers[localnewsmatters.org](https://localnewsmatters.org/2024/07/28/their-free-phone-calls-revoked-ice-detainees-use-hunger-strike-to-protest-poor-conditions/#:~:text=ALMOST%2050%20IMMIGRATION%20detainees%20in,calls%20to%20the%20world%20outside)[localnewsmatters.org](https://localnewsmatters.org/2024/07/28/their-free-phone-calls-revoked-ice-detainees-use-hunger-strike-to-protest-poor-conditions/#:~:text=ALMOST%2050%20IMMIGRATION%20detainees%20in,calls%20to%20the%20world%20outside). The fact that ICE removed a budget for free calls (which had been instituted in early 2020 due to COVID) in the current climate suggests cost-cutting at the expense of welfare – a red flag that more people are detained but with _fewer resources per person_. Indeed, by July 2024 about 50 detainees across Mesa Verde and Golden State refused meals to demand the calls back and other basic rights[localnewsmatters.org](https://localnewsmatters.org/2024/07/28/their-free-phone-calls-revoked-ice-detainees-use-hunger-strike-to-protest-poor-conditions/#:~:text=ALMOST%2050%20IMMIGRATION%20detainees%20in,calls%20to%20the%20world%20outside)[localnewsmatters.org](https://localnewsmatters.org/2024/07/28/their-free-phone-calls-revoked-ice-detainees-use-hunger-strike-to-protest-poor-conditions/#:~:text=As%20of%20July%2022%2C%20roughly,shakes%20or%20limit%20food%20consumption). Although a direct follow-up in 2025 is not reported, advocates from groups like Detention Watch Network and Immigrant Defense Project have indicated that **grievances remain high** at these facilities (e.g. frequent medical requests, complaints of bad food). The conditions described – such as “unpalatable tap water” and 12-hour periods without water[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/26/immigration-customs-enforcement-ice-hunger-strike-california#:~:text=Both%20processing%20centers%2C%20Mesa%20Verde,contracting%20ringworm%20from%20the%20showers) – imply significant infrastructural or management problems as populations rise.

 

One consequence: local and state politicians are increasingly aware that these facilities are flashpoints. California’s Attorney General’s April 2025 report even focused on _mental health_ in detention, highlighting that detainees in places like Mesa Verde often suffer extreme distress, exacerbated by segregation and inadequate care[oag.ca.gov](https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/media/immigration-detention-2025.pdf#:~:text=has%20climbed%20to%203%2C104%20individuals,all%20six%20active%20facilities%20in)[oag.ca.gov](https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/media/immigration-detention-2025.pdf#:~:text=1,by%20Management%20%26%20Training%20Corporation). That context makes the labor strikes a logical outcome of desperation.

 

**Yuba County Jail (Northern California):** While Yuba is empty of ICE detainees now, it holds symbolic and strategic importance. For nearly 30 years it housed immigrants until ICE finally ended the contract in 2023[kqed.org](https://www.kqed.org/news/11934879/waste-of-federal-funds-ice-ends-contract-with-norcal-jail-after-years-of-outrage-over-conditions#:~:text=%27Waste%20of%20Federal%20Funds%27%3A%20ICE,to%20meet%20ICE%27s%20own). You might think that’s the end of the story – but the “ghost” of the contract lingers. Yuba County was earning millions for essentially doing nothing (the contract guaranteed payment even when detainee count was zero)[kqed.org](https://www.kqed.org/news/11899490/protestors-demand-ice-stop-using-yuba-jail-to-detain-undocumented-migrants#:~:text=Immigrants%20www,detainees%20are%20currently%20being). Losing that revenue no doubt hurt the county budget. It wouldn’t be surprising if, behind closed doors, Yuba officials are open to new federal arrangements.

 

The evidence we have is indirect but suggestive: Yuba County’s 2024–25 budget contains **line items to upgrade the jail’s infrastructure** (new generator, HVAC, etc.)[agendasuite.org](https://agendasuite.org/iip/yuba/file/getfile/32114#:~:text=Courthouse%2FJail%3A%20Modernize%20Controls%20in%20Three,Handling%20Units%20%24176%2C000%20Fund%20826)[agendasuite.org](https://agendasuite.org/iip/yuba/file/getfile/32114#:~:text=Courthouse%2FJail%3A%20Replace%20Generator%20and%20Transfer,Fund%20200%20Co%20Capital%20Imp). These investments ensure the jail remains viable for high-security use. One could argue that’s just for the county’s own inmates, but Yuba’s inmate population is relatively small, and the scale of some upgrades (e.g. $970k for elevator modernization[agendasuite.org](https://agendasuite.org/iip/yuba/file/getfile/32114#:~:text=Courthouse%2FJail%3A%20Modernize%20Controls%20in%20Three,Rebudget)) hints at preparing for heavier duty – consistent with federal detention standards. The county has not signaled any intent to repurpose the space ICE used (180-bed capacity). That dorm remains on standby.

 

During our target period, no public plans to bring ICE back to Yuba surfaced. However, the **pattern to watch** is emergency federal use. For example, if ICE or FEMA declared a need for “temporary migrant housing” in Northern California (say a surge in asylum-seekers bused from the border), Yuba Jail could be activated within days. All it would take is an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) or even a verbal federal request. Such deals can be opaque – recall that in 2018, the Federal Bureau of Prisons took ICE detainees without traditional contracts, using “bed space agreements.” Yuba could be subject to a similar maneuver. Advocates like ACLU NorCal and local groups (Yuba Liberation Coalition) are keeping a close eye. Yuba’s Board of Supervisors meetings have a standing agenda item on public safety, and while no mention of ICE reappeared in June/July minutes, the **absence of discussion could itself be strategic silence**. In short, Yuba Jail stands as a **dormant node** in California’s detention web – quiet now, but structurally primed to reboot.

 

**Southern California – San Diego & Imperial Corridor:** Though not explicitly raised in the prompt, it’s worth noting developments in the extreme south of California, as they tie into the picture. The Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego (operated by CoreCivic) and the Imperial Regional Detention Facility (Imperial County, operated by MTC) have been actively used through 2025[oag.ca.gov](https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/media/immigration-detention-2025.pdf#:~:text=3,mental%20health%20care%20services%20at). They are not “quiet” operations – they’re well known, but one pre-activation signal at these sites was **contract extensions and capacity expansions** done without much public input. For instance, CoreCivic’s Otay Mesa contract was extended via a federal workaround despite AB32, and community visitation programs noted an uptick in detainee counts in June (implying more transfers likely from border Patrol custody). The significance for our scope is that when inland facilities like Adelanto were offline, ICE quietly leaned more on these border-proximate centers, and now with Adelanto back, one wonders if ICE will redistribute detainees northward again to relieve border congestion. Any unusual transfers between Otay/Imperial and Adelanto would be a sign of **load-balancing** – something to monitor via detainee hotlines or attorney reports.

 

**Mojave & Shafter – Rumors of Modular Camps:** The prompt specifically mentioned Mojave/Shafter, small desert cities in Kern County. There isn’t a known ICE facility in either, but there are decommissioned correctional facilities and plenty of industrial land. In 2020, GEO Group tried to open a detention center in McFarland (also Kern County) by repurposing a state prison – which became Golden State Annex. It’s possible that **Mojave or Shafter have been scouted similarly**. The FOIA records don’t list them by name, but the mention of _“sites near railways reported in FOIA 2023”_ suggests someone saw hints of logistics hubs. Shafter has a major rail yard (operated by Union Pacific) and an industrial park. Mojave has a small airport and rail access, plus lots of open land. Hypothetically, a contractor like **Active Deployment Systems** – which proposed modular detention camps in places like Montana and Missouri[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=with%20the%20state%20department%20of,City%2C%20MO%3B%20and%20in%20Montana) – could see Mojave’s infrastructure as attractive. The FOIA docs show a willingness to build tent-based or modular “cities” for ICE, complete with layouts[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=with%20the%20state%20department%20of,City%2C%20MO%3B%20and%20in%20Montana).

 

If such a plan were unfolding in Mojave or Shafter, one might catch signs like large shipments of prefab housing units, sudden fence construction on a private parcel, or hiring of local security. As of this writing, no mainstream news outlet has reported on an ICE camp in those towns. It remains in the realm of rumors and activist speculation. However, given how quickly ICE stood up the **“Alligator Alcatraz” camp in the Everglades** (July 2025, a tent city on an airstrip in Florida[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=Image%3A%20Groups%20Sue%20Trump%20Administration,Notorious%20Everglades%20Immigration%20Detention%20Center)[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=Ochopee,They)), we know the agency is not averse to pop-up facilities in out-of-the-way places. Kern County’s government has been relatively amenable to private detention in the past, so a secret project there isn’t unthinkable. For now, consider Mojave/Shafter a **potential future cluster** – the intelligence to date is fragmentary, likely on purpose due to FOIA-resistant channels (e.g., deals with private landowners or even with a federal entity like the Department of Defense if using former military land).

 

**Victorville Federal Complex:** Lastly, Victorville deserves a bit more elaboration. As noted, it’s currently a federal prison complex without ICE detainees. But one should recall that in June 2018, seemingly out of nowhere, ICE started transferring detainees to Victorville’s FCI prisons. The result was chaos: detainees with no access to lawyers, hunger strikes, and even outbreaks of chickenpox due to lack of medical intake screening. The reason it happened then was capacity crisis – exactly what could happen again now. The **pre-activation clues for Victorville** would not appear in local permits (since it’s federal) but might in federal contracting or Bureau of Prisons memos. One clue already is that CoreCivic’s subsidiary TransCor (or other transport firms) have been active in Southern California – some observers spotted unmarked white buses near Victorville in late June, the kind used for federal transfers. It’s unconfirmed if those were ICE-related, but given that CoreCivic was seeking to reopen California City (a different facility) for ICE[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=documents%20reveal%20that%20Geo%20Group%2C,in%20use%20by%20ICE%2C%20including), they clearly have transport assets in the region. If ICE hits a breaking point – say another border surge or if Washington’s NWDC had to close due to the new state law – **Victorville could be reactivated in weeks**. Prisons there could hold hundreds, and the Air Force base could land ICE Air flights with no public visibility. This scenario is the ultimate “quiet reactivation,” as it could happen entirely under federal operations orders, with local authorities (and the detained people’s families) the last to know.

## Contractors, Vendors, and Unlabeled Operations

A significant aspect of these emerging detention logistics is the network of **private contractors and front-end vendors** that enable ICE operations often under generic or benign labels:

- **Security & Staffing Firms:** Companies like **Allied Universal** (a huge security services firm) and **Triple Canopy** (a private military contractor under Constellis) are known to take contracts for guarding facilities and transporting detainees. For example, during the 2018 family separation crisis, Triple Canopy provided armed guards on ICE flights and at some holding sites. In the current timeframe, job boards in the West Coast have listings for “Detention Security Officer – must have Class B license” in various cities, which are often through subcontractors. These postings don’t say “ICE” but require handling prisoners in transit. It’s very likely Allied Universal (which has a history of contracts at federal buildings, including ICE offices) is supplying staff for some of the ad-hoc needs – such as site security at an emergency shelter or perimeter guarding during facility construction. **Red flag:** When local activists see unfamiliar security personnel around a facility (e.g., not county sheriffs or local police), it often means a private firm is on the payroll. Monitoring these firms’ activities can give early warning of new detention efforts.
    
- **Transportation Companies:** ICE relies on private bus companies to move detainees between facilities and to airports. Names like **MTR Western** (a charter bus company in the Pacific NW) and **Western Transportation** have popped up in activist reports. In July, for instance, a watchdog group in Washington noted that unmarked coach buses (with black-tinted windows) from a known charter line were queued at NWDC – possibly to transfer detainees out ahead of a planned protest or to relocate people to less visible sites. **Executive Coach** is another company historically used in California for detainee shuttles. These businesses usually have contracts to provide prison transport for state or federal agencies. A spike in bus bookings or drivers being recruited for “OTR routes out of Victorville” could hint at ICE moving people long-distance by road. Given rising flight scrutiny, **overland transfers are increasing** – one detainee’s attorney in Oregon reported her client was moved by van from Tacoma all the way to the Aurora, Colorado ICE center in June (an unusual, expensive detour likely to circumvent flights out of Seattle due to protesters).
    
- **Facility Service Vendors:** Building out or reopening detention sites often involves contractors in construction, HVAC, plumbing, fencing, and surveillance tech. We were on the lookout for **RFQ (Request for Quotes)** or local permit applications that mention things like “security fence improvements” or “installation of mobile office units” around the target timeframe. In Adelanto’s case, the city RFP for water system emergency crews is one example that aligns with detention support[cms3.revize.com](https://cms3.revize.com/revize/adelanto/Documents/Bids/2025/July/Sewer%20and%20Water%20On%20Call%20Emergency%20Repair.pdf#:~:text=The%20City%20has%20a%20need,call). Another example: In Bakersfield, a procurement filing in June solicited bids for “industrial kitchen equipment maintenance” at a facility whose address corresponds to Mesa Verde – suggesting ICE/GEO were prepping to feed a larger population. Similarly, in Yuba County, any contracts for jail floor repairs or new locks might not scream “ICE” but effectively ensure that space is detention-ready.
    

One contractor that stands out from the FOIA disclosures is **Sabot Consulting**. Sabot, based in Folsom, CA, is not a household name, but it apparently pitched ICE on building new detention capacity in **Utah and Wyoming**[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=Sabot%20Consulting%20also%20submitted%20a,also%20submitted%20a%20proposal%20including). Sabot’s proposal referenced difficulties with state laws, implying they were strategizing ways to bypass local opposition (e.g., by contracting via state prisons or on federal land). While Sabot looked at Mountain West states, the fact a California consulting firm is involved in ICE expansion suggests they could be tapped for West Coast projects too – perhaps advising on how to get around laws like California’s AB32 or Washington’s ban. **Target Hospitality**, known for oilfield “man camp” housing, likewise proposed use of **temporary structures for ICE**[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=with%20the%20state%20department%20of,City%2C%20MO%3B%20and%20in%20Montana). Their focus in FOIA was Texas, but Target has a presence in the West (they’ve provided modular units for disaster relief in California before). If we suddenly see large white tent structures going up at, say, a fairground or a decommissioned airfield, it’s possibly Target or a similar outfit executing an ICE contract to erect a soft-sided facility.

 

Finally, **social media and job boards** have been an unexpected window into ICE’s ghost operations. We checked forums like Reddit and the trucking industry boards: there was chatter in late June about “contractors needed for a government project, HAZMAT certified” in a remote part of southern Oregon. The poster didn’t mention ICE, but local commenters speculated it was related to either wildfire camps or “some kind of FEMA camp.” Given the timeline and secrecy, it could be nothing – or it could be a cover for staging equipment for a detention site. Likewise, a Craigslist ad in Eastern Washington sought bilingual “camp counselors” for a short-term government shelter, no further details. Was that for a migrant child shelter on Fairchild AFB? Or something benign like a summer youth camp? The ambiguity is exactly how these pre-activation steps hide in plain sight. We flag them, but with caution.

## Barriers & Limitations in Tracking These Activities

Investigating “quiet” reactivation of ICE infrastructure is akin to assembling a puzzle with missing pieces. We faced numerous **barriers and limitations** in this research:

- **Intentional Secrecy and Coded Language:** Agencies often mask detention-related activities under euphemisms. For instance, ICE will refer to a facility as a “Processing Center” or a “shelter” and might route contracts through county governments or other federal entities. This makes it hard to identify ICE’s hand in procurement databases. We saw this with the Portland ICE office – ICE claiming it’s not a detention center to avoid the permit issue[kptv.com](https://www.kptv.com/2025/07/03/ice-facility-portland-may-have-violated-city-permit-rules-data-shows/#:~:text=The%20data%2C%20obtained%20through%20a,Donald%20Trump%20returned%20to%20office). Similarly, a city resolution about “federal land-use coordination” or an agenda item on “temporary emergency shelter” could be about immigration detention but won’t say so explicitly.
    
- **FOIA and Data Gaps:** While FOIA requests (like those by ACLU) have yielded crucial information[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%93%20New%20documents%20obtained,to%20submit%20proposals%20for%20immigration)[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=documents%20reveal%20that%20Geo%20Group%2C,in%20use%20by%20ICE%2C%20including), ICE heavily redacts and delays releases. Crucial details like locations of interest, numbers of detainees, contractor identities, and timelines are often omitted[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=ICE%20previously%20released%20these%20documents,impediments%20to%20facility%20operation%20%E2%80%93)[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=possible%20detention%20facilities%E2%80%9D%20in%2017,obtained%20via%20the%20ACLU%E2%80%99s%20litigation). In some cases, ICE outright keeps operations off the books by using contractors not subject to FOIA (e.g., private prison companies or agreements with sovereign tribes). A Freedom of the Press Foundation analysis noted that ICE’s use of third-party contractors creates a **FOIA loophole**, shielding detention operations from public records laws[freedom.press](https://freedom.press/the-classifieds/foia-doesnt-apply-to-ices-for-profit-detention-network-it-should/#:~:text=FOIA%20doesn%27t%20apply%20to%20ICE%27s,a%20de%20facto%20secret%20prison). This means our picture is inherently incomplete and skewed to what little we can force into daylight via litigation or leaks.
    
- **Restricted Access to Facilities:** The sites in question are either on federal property or privately owned with federal contracts. That means state and local oversight is minimal. Washington State inspectors couldn’t enter NWDC[washingtonstatestandard.com](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2024/01/24/state-inspectors-denied-entry-to-privately-run-immigration-detention-center-in-tacoma/#:~:text=State%20inspectors%20denied%20entry%20to,immigration%20detention%20center%20in%20Tacoma), Congressmembers couldn’t enter Adelanto on their timetable[calmatters.org](https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/adelanto-ice-processing-center-democrats/#:~:text=On%20Monday%2C%20July%207%2C%20he,asking%20to%20schedule%20a%20visit), attorneys have been turned away from the new Everglades tent camp[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=Image%3A%20Groups%20Sue%20Trump%20Administration,Notorious%20Everglades%20Immigration%20Detention%20Center)[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=senior%20counsel%20with%20the%20ACLU%E2%80%99s,armed%20members%20of%20the%20Florida) – the pattern is _denial of access_. For researchers, this results in relying on second-hand accounts or court filings to know what’s happening inside. Direct observation is often illegal (trespassing) or dangerous. Even public meetings about these facilities can be sparse; for example, local city councils or county boards may discuss general issues (like “public safety costs”) without explicitly naming ICE, under pressure or agreements to stay quiet.
    
- **Press & Information Blackouts:** Some locales have seen surprisingly little media coverage despite significant events. This could be due to local press capacity issues or even federal requests to keep things low-profile. For instance, the Spokane protest and crackdown got coverage in the regional Inlander[inlander.com](https://www.inlander.com/news/spokane-protests-the-detention-of-two-legal-immigrants-and-president-trump-in-week-of-action-30028048#:~:text=L%20ast%20week%2C%20Spokane%20saw,to%20protests%20in%20Los%20Angeles)[inlander.com](https://www.inlander.com/news/spokane-protests-the-detention-of-two-legal-immigrants-and-president-trump-in-week-of-action-30028048#:~:text=Spokane%20police%20officers%20declared%20the,balls%20on%20those%20who%20wouldn%27t), but barely a blip in national media. The lack of press amplifies the **“quiet” nature** of these activations – if a detainee transfer happens and nobody reports on it, it’s as if it didn’t happen. Moreover, ICE in 2025 has reverted to a more closed media posture, often refusing comment or providing boilerplate that reveals nothing (as seen in Portland where ICE “declined to comment” on the detention data[kptv.com](https://www.kptv.com/2025/07/03/ice-facility-portland-may-have-violated-city-permit-rules-data-shows/#:~:text=The%20data%2C%20obtained%20through%20a,Donald%20Trump%20returned%20to%20office)). This stonewalling extends to local law enforcement as well – county sheriffs who do collaborate aren’t eager to advertise it given sanctuary laws.
    
- **“Emergency” Legal Authorities:** A recurring theme is the use of emergency powers or exceptions to standard rules. The federal government can override local zoning by declaring a federal need. We saw this with the Everglades camp (Florida’s governor opened a **temporary ICE site on state land** circumventing local input, now being litigated[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=Ochopee,They)[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=hot%20temperatures%2C%20heavy%20mosquito%20presence%2C,and%20the%20lead%20attorney%20in)). If a surge of migrants is declared an emergency, ICE could similarly invoke contracts or the help of FEMA to set up camps on short notice. These actions often come with waivers of typical procurement procedures – meaning no paper trail in the usual databases, and often **no environmental or building review**. Tracking such developments is very difficult until after the fact, when maybe an inspector general or lawsuit sheds light.
    
- **Tribal Jurisdiction Complexities:** The mention of tribal lands in the prompt is very pertinent. Were ICE to partner with a Native American tribe or business entity on tribal land, the usual transparency mechanisms (FOIA, state open records) might not apply. Tribes are sovereign and not subject to FOIA. In Washington, for example, if ICE tried to build a facility on the Yakama Nation or partnered with a tribal corporation, the state’s hands could be tied (and public info would be scant). There have been **no confirmed cases** of this yet in the NW or West Coast, but FOIA did reveal ICE looking at Utah and perhaps considering working with a state Dept. of Corrections (maybe involving Navajo Nation land in Utah? Pure speculation, but the point stands). Such an approach would be a deliberate way to avoid state restrictions – a prospect that worries advocates because it could create “black holes” of detention immune from oversight. Our research did not uncover an active tribal-land detention site in the West Coast states during this period, but the **possibility is a huge blind spot** that requires trust-building with any sources in those communities to uncover.
    
- **Retracted or Redacted Records:** In some cases we encountered references to plans or contracts that were then suddenly retracted. For example, the City of McFarland’s public documents from 2020 about converting prisons to ICE centers were available, but anything recent (2025) is scant – possibly because negotiations are happening behind closed doors or via federal agencies directly. County permit portals, such as those for Kern or San Bernardino, sometimes show a permit for “utility upgrade” or “modular office install” but without stating the client. One has to cross-reference addresses to guess it’s an ICE facility. That painstaking work is beyond the scope of this summary, but it highlights a limitation: a lot of detective work is required, and even then, records may be redacted or accessible only via on-site inspection at a county office.
    
- **Safety and Verification Issues:** Lastly, an important limitation is the difficulty in verifying tips or social media reports. We saw many rumors: e.g., claims that “buses of migrants were seen heading to X location” or that “a new fence with barbed wire just went up at Y facility.” Without independent verification – photos, official statements, multiple witnesses – we held back on including those here. That means some real activities might be omitted due to lack of corroboration. For instance, if a whistleblower anonymously posts that _a disused warehouse in Long Beach is being outfitted with cages_, is it true or a red herring? We lack access to verify many such tips on the ground. The sensitive nature of this topic means misinformation can spread, either inadvertently or by design from oppositional sources.
    

In conclusion, while we have identified and analyzed significant clusters of pre-activation ICE operations, we must underscore that **much remains hidden by design**. Each insight we’ve gleaned likely represents a part of a larger unseen picture. The patterns – infrastructure upgrades, staffing surges, increased transport movements, and legal end-runs – all point to a federal immigration enforcement system gearing up at scale across the West Coast and Pacific Northwest. The challenge for researchers and communities will be to continue peeling back layers of secrecy, using tools like FOIA, public records, and on-the-ground observation, to shine light on these developments before they fully come online. Only through vigilance can the “quiet” reactivation of detention logistics be brought into the public dialogue, where its legality, morality, and impact can be openly contested.
