## Texas: Expanding Detention Footprint and Quiet Preparations

**Fort Bliss (El Paso):** At the sprawling Army base, ICE is erecting a massive “deportation hub” under the Trump administration’s plan[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-army-fort-bliss-deportation-detention#:~:text=Situated%20in%20the%20heart%20of,immigration%20agenda)[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-army-fort-bliss-deportation-detention#:~:text=Under%20the%20proposal%2C%20Fort%20Bliss,Ice%29%20detention%20capacity). A new soft-sided camp on base is set to hold up to 3,500 detainees in military-style tents[elpasomatters.org](https://elpasomatters.org/2025/06/24/ice-detention-facility-el-paso/#:~:text=about%207%2C500%20since%20March%2030%2C,Escobar%20added), making it one of the largest such facilities in the country. Notably, this project advanced with minimal local input since it’s on federal land. In April, ICE awarded a **$3.8 billion** operations contract to Deployed Resources LLC – a private “base camp” contractor – only to cancel it days later without public explanation[propublica.org](https://www.propublica.org/article/ice-cancels-contract-immigrant-detention-camp-fort-bliss#:~:text=Then%2C%20on%20April%2013%2C%20the,to%20the%20federal%20contracting%20site). **Sources confirm the tent camp is still moving forward** on a revised procurement, and a mid-April site tour drew at least 10 interested companies[texastribune.org](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/11/trump-deportations-deployed-resources-tent-company/#:~:text=one%20of%20the%20companies%20hoping,on%20elements%20of%20the%20plan). By late June, officials said the Fort Bliss facility would open within “weeks”[elpasomatters.org](https://elpasomatters.org/2025/06/24/ice-detention-facility-el-paso/#:~:text=about%207%2C500%20since%20March%2030%2C,Escobar%20added). This rapid development largely escaped city permitting processes, raising oversight concerns. The contractor Deployed Resources has a controversial track record of lucrative government deals and subpar conditions at similar border camps[texastribune.org](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/11/trump-deportations-deployed-resources-tent-company/#:~:text=In%20the%20spring%20of%202019%2C,press%20and%20then%20hung%20up)[texastribune.org](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/11/trump-deportations-deployed-resources-tent-company/#:~:text=Deployed%20has%20continued%20to%20win,government%20watchdogs%20and%20a%20whistleblower). Red flags include the unusual contract award-and-cancellation (a sign of potential bidding irregularities) and the use of **military emergency authority** (declared by President Trump) to fund the project via DOD budgets, skirting some transparency[texastribune.org](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/11/trump-deportations-deployed-resources-tent-company/#:~:text=Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement%20posted,tents%20before%20they%20are%20deported)[texastribune.org](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/11/trump-deportations-deployed-resources-tent-company/#:~:text=use%20one%20of%20those%20border,by%20Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement). Local leaders like Rep. Veronica Escobar have voiced concerns about a military base doubling as a detention center, both for humanitarian and military-readiness reasons[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-army-fort-bliss-deportation-detention#:~:text=The%20Democratic%20Texas%20congresswoman%20Veronica,effectiveness%20of%20US%20military%20forces)[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-army-fort-bliss-deportation-detention#:~:text=Escobar%20said%3A%20%E2%80%9CThere%20is%20no,%E2%80%9D).

 

**El Paso “Northeast” Tent Facility:** In parallel, ICE has repurposed an existing 153,000 sq.ft. tent complex on El Paso’s northeast outskirts (erected by CBP in 2023)[elpasomatters.org](https://elpasomatters.org/2025/06/24/ice-detention-facility-el-paso/#:~:text=Sign%20up). Since ICE took it over in March 2025 as a _“decompression and staging site”_ for deportations, detainee numbers have **surged ten-fold** – from under 100 to about 900 in mid-June[elpasomatters.org](https://elpasomatters.org/2025/06/24/ice-detention-facility-el-paso/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20immigrants%20being,roundups%20throughout%20the%20country%20continue)[elpasomatters.org](https://elpasomatters.org/2025/06/24/ice-detention-facility-el-paso/#:~:text=An%20unknown%20number%20of%20detainees,detention%20facility%20in%20New%20Jersey). This rapid influx came amid nationally coordinated ICE raids and even an emergency transfer of detainees from a distant NJ jail after an escape[elpasomatters.org](https://elpasomatters.org/2025/06/24/ice-detention-facility-el-paso/#:~:text=Nearly%2056%2C400%20people%20were%20in,the%20week%20ending%20June%209). The tent camp (capacity ~1,000) is now a key waypoint for deportation flights. Detainees stay only ~5 days on average before transfer or removal, relieving pressure on ICE’s older El Paso Processing Center (which itself is near capacity)[elpasomatters.org](https://elpasomatters.org/2025/06/24/ice-detention-facility-el-paso/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20that%20tent,capacity%20of%20about%201%2C000%20people).

Homeland Security has actively _discouraged_ unannounced visits by officials – as of June 19, ICE instituted a 72-hour notice policy for Congress members inspecting facilities[elpasomatters.org](https://elpasomatters.org/2025/06/24/ice-detention-facility-el-paso/#:~:text=Escobar%20said%20she%20didn%E2%80%99t%20have,ICE%20ahead%20of%20her%20visit). This policy drew criticism, given reports that conditions inside the tent camp remain spartan (though Rep. Escobar, after a monitored visit, claimed basic needs like food, water, and showers were being met)[elpasomatters.org](https://elpasomatters.org/2025/06/24/ice-detention-facility-el-paso/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20is%20in%20many%20respects,and%20access%20to%20their%20attorneys). The **pre-activation clues** here included a flurry of subcontractor activity in spring 2025: e.g. **Apex Site Services** and other logistics firms were observed installing fencing, generators, HVAC units, and other infrastructure to winterize and upgrade the tents (per local sources, though specifics were not widely publicized). The _El Paso Matters_ investigative piece on June 24 shed first light on the massive scale-up at this once-idle camp[elpasomatters.org](https://elpasomatters.org/2025/06/24/ice-detention-facility-el-paso/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20immigrants%20being,roundups%20throughout%20the%20country%20continue)[elpasomatters.org](https://elpasomatters.org/2025/06/24/ice-detention-facility-el-paso/#:~:text=The%20tent%20facility%20is%20in,open%20in%20the%20coming%20weeks), breaking through what had been a period of relative official silence.

 

**Dilley Family Detention Center:** Further east in South Texas, the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley (Frio County) is coming back online after a hiatus. CoreCivic (the private operator) and **Target Hospitality Corp.** (which owns the facility’s modular housing) announced a **5-year lease agreement in March 2025** to resume ICE detention at Dilley[investors.targethospitality.com](https://investors.targethospitality.com/news/news-details/2025/Target-Hospitality-Announces-5-year-Contract-Award-Reactivating-South-Texas-Assets/default.aspx#:~:text=THE%20WOODLANDS%2C%20Texas%2C%20March%206%2C,Dilley%20Contract)[investors.targethospitality.com](https://investors.targethospitality.com/news/news-details/2025/Target-Hospitality-Announces-5-year-Contract-Award-Reactivating-South-Texas-Assets/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20Dilley%20Facility%20will%20be,for%20a%20seamless%20community%20reactivation). The site – America’s largest family detention center – can hold up to **2,400 parents and children**[investors.targethospitality.com](https://investors.targethospitality.com/news/news-details/2025/Target-Hospitality-Announces-5-year-Contract-Award-Reactivating-South-Texas-Assets/default.aspx#:~:text=These%20assets%20operated%20from%20September,scope%20as%20the%20prior%20operations). It previously closed to new families in 2021, but now has been “seamlessly reactivated” with the same layout, requiring _“no capital investment”_ to restart operations[investors.targethospitality.com](https://investors.targethospitality.com/news/news-details/2025/Target-Hospitality-Announces-5-year-Contract-Award-Reactivating-South-Texas-Assets/default.aspx#:~:text=These%20assets%20operated%20from%20September,scope%20as%20the%20prior%20operations). By June, about 300 people were detained there and only two of the five housing areas were open[latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-06-21/new-insight-into-texas-family-detention-reveals-adults-fighting-kids-for-clean-water#:~:text=brought%20in) – indicating ICE could rapidly scale up intake when desired. The arrangement is structured via an IGSA subcontract: the City of Dilley holds the ICE contract and CoreCivic/Target run the site, with guaranteed payments **regardless of occupancy**[investors.targethospitality.com](https://investors.targethospitality.com/news/news-details/2025/Target-Hospitality-Announces-5-year-Contract-Award-Reactivating-South-Texas-Assets/default.aspx#:~:text=Target%20will%20provide%20facility%20and,will%20be%20realized%20in%202025). While local officials tout economic benefits, immigrant rights monitors have raised alarms. **A federal lawsuit filed June 30** describes _“inhumane conditions”_ at Dilley: families packed into _cramped metal trailers_, insufficient food and water, and poor medical care[ksat.com](https://www.ksat.com/video/news/2025/06/30/families-detained-in-dilley-immigrant-center-allege-inhumane-conditions-in-new-lawsuit/#:~:text=A%20new%20lawsuit%20alleges%20families,a%20Dilley%20immigrant%20detention%20center). These accounts, collected by legal observers under the _Flores_ settlement, paint a grim picture of neglect: children fighting illnesses without adequate treatment, detainees jostling for scarce bottled water, and even a baby losing weight in custody[latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-06-21/new-insight-into-texas-family-detention-reveals-adults-fighting-kids-for-clean-water#:~:text=One%20mother%20was%20told%20she,over%20one%20another%20for%20water)[latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-06-21/new-insight-into-texas-family-detention-reveals-adults-fighting-kids-for-clean-water#:~:text=One%20family%20with%20a%20young,in%20detention%20for%20a%20month). CoreCivic disputes these claims publicly, insisting they meet federal standards, but the **discrepancy** between the official “open and safe environment” narrative and detainees’ reports is stark[azmirror.com](https://azmirror.com/2025/06/16/qa-rep-yassamin-ansari-on-eloy-detention-center-el-salvador-and-the-new-travel-ban/#:~:text=She%20called%20what%20she%20heard,profit%20company%20CoreCivic%2C%20%E2%80%9Csickening.%E2%80%9D)[azmirror.com](https://azmirror.com/2025/06/16/qa-rep-yassamin-ansari-on-eloy-detention-center-el-salvador-and-the-new-travel-ban/#:~:text=Republic%20www,%E2%80%9D). Notably, Dilley’s remote location and controlled media access have kept local public outcry to a minimum – a form of _de facto_ community silence. The center sits in a small town economically tied to the facility, which may also explain the muted local response (no significant protests reported in Dilley).

 

**Karnes County ICE Facility:** Similarly, the Karnes County Residential Center (near Karnes City, TX) has reactivated after being largely idle in 2021–22. GEO Group operates Karnes under an agreement with the county. Originally a family facility, Karnes was converted to an adult women’s detention site, then saw a scale-down – but **by late 2024 it returned to holding families**, part of the mass interior detention push. By June 2025, NGOs confirmed _children as young as toddlers_ were held there alongside parents. Disturbingly, **water supply issues** have been documented. In one account from a 16-year-old detainee in Karnes, _“We don’t get enough water. They put out a little case…and everyone has to run for it”_, with an adult even **knocking down a child** to grab bottled water[latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-06-21/new-insight-into-texas-family-detention-reveals-adults-fighting-kids-for-clean-water#:~:text=One%20mother%20was%20told%20she,over%20one%20another%20for%20water). Such scenes underscore insufficient provisioning despite soaring summer heat. The facility’s **population remains well below its ~830 capacity** (like Dilley, it’s ramping up gradually), but advocates fear that as ICE fills every bed, these issues will worsen. Karnes’s rural county leadership has historically been _cooperative_ with ICE – indeed, they protested when the Biden administration cut back family detention in 2021, citing lost revenue. Now, with Trump-era policies, Karnes is again a beneficiary of federal contracts, and local officials have been publicly quiet about any problems. This _passive enablement_ by local authorities, combined with limited press (coverage of Karnes conditions has come mostly via national outlets or court filings, not local media), suggests a climate where ICE and GEO can expand operations without immediate community pushback.

 

**Laredo and South Texas Enforcement Surge:** An important precursor to facility expansion is the **stepped-up interior enforcement** feeding the pipeline. The Laredo region saw multiple large-scale ICE raids in late June. For example, on June 26, ICE agents swarmed a warehouse near I-35, arresting dozens and causing highway chaos as panicked workers fled[kgns.tv](https://www.kgns.tv/2025/06/26/ice-lfd-laredo-officials-address-warehouse-raid-that-led-chaos-i-35/#:~:text=ICE%2C%20fire%20officials%20address%20warehouse,as%20dozens%20of%20people). Earlier, on June 10, another raid (details undisclosed by ICE) took place in Laredo[lmtonline.com](https://www.lmtonline.com/local/article/laredo-texas-ice-raids-worksite-enforcement-hsi-20377414.php#:~:text=ICE%20raid%20in%20Laredo%20prompts,recent%20Immigration%20and%20Customs). And on June 6, in a nationally televised operation, **ICE planes landed in San Antonio** carrying migrant families (men, women, and at least 7 children) from out-of-state, who were then bused under escort to detention centers[news4sanantonio.com](https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/video-shows-ice-agents-escorting-families-off-planes-onto-buses-in-san-antonio#:~:text=Multiple%20rounds%20of%20planes%20arrived,seen%20boarding%20a%20charter%20bus)[news4sanantonio.com](https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/video-shows-ice-agents-escorting-families-off-planes-onto-buses-in-san-antonio#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20detention%20centers,an%20hour%20from%20San%20Antonio). Local TV footage captured a somber procession of shackled families – a highly unusual sight in that area. It later emerged they were likely bound for **Dilley** (about an hour southwest of San Antonio) and **Karnes City** (an hour southeast)[news4sanantonio.com](https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/video-shows-ice-agents-escorting-families-off-planes-onto-buses-in-san-antonio#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20detention%20centers,an%20hour%20from%20San%20Antonio)[news4sanantonio.com](https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/video-shows-ice-agents-escorting-families-off-planes-onto-buses-in-san-antonio#:~:text=The%20detention%20center%20in%20Dilley%2C,an%20hour%20southeast%20of%20here), which had space ready. ICE’s San Antonio field office termed it “routine transfer flights”[news4sanantonio.com](https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/video-shows-ice-agents-escorting-families-off-planes-onto-buses-in-san-antonio#:~:text=in%20history%2C%20detaining%202%2C200%20people,on%20that%20day%20alone), but to onlookers it was clear this was part of a _“massive ramp-up”_ of enforcement[news4sanantonio.com](https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/video-shows-ice-agents-escorting-families-off-planes-onto-buses-in-san-antonio#:~:text=here). Indeed, News 4 San Antonio reported that on Tuesday, June 3, ICE made **2,200 arrests in a single day – an all-time record[news4sanantonio.com](https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/video-shows-ice-agents-escorting-families-off-planes-onto-buses-in-san-antonio#:~:text=here). This reflects Trump officials’ stated goal of **3,000 arrests per day nationwide**, nearly a 5× jump from early 2025 levels[latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-06-21/new-insight-into-texas-family-detention-reveals-adults-fighting-kids-for-clean-water#:~:text=Stephen%20Miller%2C%20White%20House%20deputy,months%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20second%20term). Such raids often occur with little advance public notice and with the cooperation (or at least acquiescence) of local law enforcement. In Laredo’s case, after community questions, the Laredo police and county sheriff issued statements clarifying they were _not_ directly involved in the ICE operations[kgns.tv](https://www.kgns.tv/video/2025/06/12/closer-look-laredo-police-sheriff-clarify-roles-ice-raids/#:~:text=A%20CLOSER%20LOOK%3A%20Laredo%20Police,8888) – likely to manage community relations. However, the chilling effect on immigrant communities has been noted (e.g. reports of canceled July 4th events in some cities due to fear of raids).

 

_Implication:_ Texas is witnessing a concerted, multi-front effort: **build or reopen detention capacity quietly, then aggressively fill it through raids and transfers**. The pre-activation phase has featured telltale signals: sudden contractor activity on federal sites, large orders of supplies (water, generators, tents) to remote towns, job postings for detention staff, and unusual charter flights. Many of these happened with minimal public announcements, relying on the urgency of Trump’s directives to override typical transparency. Nevertheless, pockets of resistance – such as legal challenges and investigative media – have begun to shed light on what’s brewing in Texas.

## Arizona: Scaling Up Capacity Amid Oversight Battles

**Florence and Eloy Detention Centers:** Arizona hosts two major ICE detention complexes run by private firms (CoreCivic in Eloy; CoreCivic and ICE at Florence). These facilities are slated for **significant expansion** under new federal funding. The Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” (signed in June) allocates **$45 billion** to immigration detention, with Arizona expected to gain thousands of new beds[azfamily.com](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/07/08/arizona-ice-detention-centers-could-expand-amid-45-billion-funding-increase/#:~:text=plan%20%20is%20facing%20sharp,funneling%20billions%20into%20immigration%20enforcement)[azfamily.com](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/07/08/arizona-ice-detention-centers-could-expand-amid-45-billion-funding-increase/#:~:text=Rodriguez%20is%20the%20founder%20of,adding%20thousands%20of%20new%20beds). CoreCivic’s Eloy Detention Center is already one of ICE’s largest centers, and plans indicate it could grow further – possibly by reactivating dormant units or augmenting with portable housing. Local advocates like Dora Rodriguez note that **both Eloy and Florence could dramatically increase capacity** given the influx of money[azfamily.com](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/07/08/arizona-ice-detention-centers-could-expand-amid-45-billion-funding-increase/#:~:text=Rodriguez%20is%20the%20founder%20of,adding%20thousands%20of%20new%20beds)[azfamily.com](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/07/08/arizona-ice-detention-centers-could-expand-amid-45-billion-funding-increase/#:~:text=locations%20could%20see%20a%20dramatic,adding%20thousands%20of%20new%20beds). For example, additional dorms could be opened at the sprawling Florence campus (which also includes a ICE Processing Center) and at Eloy’s adjacent La Palma Correctional facility.

 

However, Arizona’s facilities are under heavy scrutiny for conditions. In mid-June, **Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-AZ)** made a surprise inspection of Eloy Detention Center, calling what she found _“sickening”_. Detainees told her they _“do not have reliable access to basics like food and water or essential medical care”_[azmirror.com](https://azmirror.com/2025/06/16/qa-rep-yassamin-ansari-on-eloy-detention-center-el-salvador-and-the-new-travel-ban/#:~:text=She%20called%20what%20she%20heard,profit%20company%20CoreCivic%2C%20%E2%80%9Csickening.%E2%80%9D). She heard of _moldy, overcrowded cells_ and even forced marches in 100°F+ heat as punitive measures[azmirror.com](https://azmirror.com/2025/06/16/qa-rep-yassamin-ansari-on-eloy-detention-center-el-salvador-and-the-new-travel-ban/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSo%20many%20of%20the%20detainees,%E2%80%9D). These reports line up with years of complaints documented by the Florence Project and others, alleging racist treatment by some guards and chronic neglect of health needs[azmirror.com](https://azmirror.com/2025/06/16/qa-rep-yassamin-ansari-on-eloy-detention-center-el-salvador-and-the-new-travel-ban/#:~:text=Republic%20www,%E2%80%9D). CoreCivic’s spokesperson, for his part, insisted that Eloy adheres to federal standards and welcomed Ansari’s oversight in principle[azmirror.com](https://azmirror.com/2025/06/16/qa-rep-yassamin-ansari-on-eloy-detention-center-el-salvador-and-the-new-travel-ban/#:~:text=moldy%20cells%2C%20forced%20and%20dehumanizing,%E2%80%9D). The tension between official statements and detainee experiences remains unresolved. Notably, **Arizona has a contingent of vocal elected officials** raising alarms (Ansari at the federal level, plus some state legislators). This suggests any sudden build-out – say, a new tent annex or expansion of bed capacity – could face public questioning. Still, **little local permission is needed** for ICE to expand on existing contract sites; Arizona has no law against private immigration prisons (attempts to legislate one have stalled).

 

On June 25, immigrant rights groups staged a protest outside Eloy Detention Center, illustrating community pushback. _Dozens of protesters_ held signs decrying the mass arrests and detentions, emphasizing that ~70% of the 56,000 immigrants in ICE custody **have no criminal convictions**[azfamily.com](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/06/25/groups-protest-outside-eloy-detention-center-against-immigration-arrests/#:~:text=The%20demonstration%20highlighted%20the%20human,have%20criminal%20convictions)[azfamily.com](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/06/25/groups-protest-outside-eloy-detention-center-against-immigration-arrests/#:~:text=records,have%20criminal%20convictions). They urged humane treatment and questioned the rush to incarcerate asylum-seekers. The protest also responded to DHS Secretary **Kristi Noem’s** announcement that detention facilities would be expanded nationwide to accommodate the spike in arrests – **over 5,000 immigrants were detained in just the first two weeks of June** under the crackdown[azfamily.com](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/06/25/groups-protest-outside-eloy-detention-center-against-immigration-arrests/#:~:text=immigrant%20detentions%20by%20ICE). While peaceful, the demonstration in Eloy is notable: it’s happening in a town heavily dependent on the detention industry (Eloy’s economy revolves around prisons). This suggests growing statewide awareness and possibly organizing against the expansion. There are also reports (via social media) that tribal communities and humanitarian groups along the **Arizona-Mexico border (e.g. Tohono O’odham Nation)** are watching for any attempt by DHS to use tribal lands or nearby military sites for overflow detention camps – no such moves have been confirmed, but the inclusion of “tribal lands under federal leasing” in planning documents has raised sensitivities.

 

**Yuma and Tucson Sectors:** In the Yuma area, there were no specific new detention facilities identified in this period, but Yuma’s Border Patrol processing tent (erected in 2021) remains on standby if border crossings spike. More directly relevant is **Tucson**, which serves as a logistics hub. Tucson’s ICE Air operations at the airport ramped up throughput of deportees in June. For instance, ICE Air flight logs show numerous **Tucson-originating removal flights** to Central America, often multiple per week in late June (exact figures aren’t published, but El Paso had 27 flights in May for comparison[elpasomatters.org](https://elpasomatters.org/2025/06/24/ice-detention-facility-el-paso/#:~:text=ICE%20conducted%20190%20deportation%20flights,to%20the%20New%20York%20Times)). The Migrant Insider report (Cartwright’s data) noted **military C-130 aircraft** were used for at least **10 deportation flights in June** – including some from Arizona’s region – as the administration “normalizes” military involvement in removals[migrantinsider.com](https://migrantinsider.com/p/ice-air-deportation-flights-surge#:~:text=Military%20Deportations%20Surge%20at%20Month%E2%80%99s,End). Seven military-run deportation flights occurred on a single day, June 29[migrantinsider.com](https://migrantinsider.com/p/ice-air-deportation-flights-surge#:~:text=Military%20aircraft%20were%20used%20for,military%20involvement%20in%20immigration%20enforcement), likely from border airfields like Tucson or Yuma direct to Latin American countries. This indicates a blending of DHS and DOD resources to hustle people out quickly. For Tucson, another key indicator is the city’s role in detainee “shuffling”: a number of those 697 domestic transfer flights in June moved detainees **into Arizona** (for example, to _Florence_ or _Eloy_ from out of state)[migrantinsider.com](https://migrantinsider.com/p/ice-air-deportation-flights-surge#:~:text=Domestic%20%E2%80%98Shuffle%E2%80%99%20Flights%20Reach%20Record,Levels). These transfers usually happen under the radar – charter planes land at off-peak hours, and contract buses ferry detainees to the prisons.

 

Local political posture in Arizona is mixed. Pima County (Tucson) officials have generally opposed border militarization and might object if, say, the National Guard Armory in Tucson were used to stage ICE detainees. Meanwhile, rural Pinal County (where Eloy and Florence sit) remains supportive of the private detention centers for the jobs they provide. There is **one clear discrepancy** to monitor: while DHS claims these expansions will “reduce overcrowding” and improve conditions through better staffing[azfamily.com](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/07/08/arizona-ice-detention-centers-could-expand-amid-45-billion-funding-increase/#:~:text=quotas%20to%20get%20to%20that,money%2C%E2%80%9D%20Rodriguez%20said), advocates argue the opposite – that pouring money into private prisons incentivizes filling every bed for profit, at the expense of due process and humane standards[azfamily.com](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/07/08/arizona-ice-detention-centers-could-expand-amid-45-billion-funding-increase/#:~:text=The%20administration%20says%20the%20money,that%20prioritizes%20incarceration%20over%20reform)[azfamily.com](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/07/08/arizona-ice-detention-centers-could-expand-amid-45-billion-funding-increase/#:~:text=children%20sleeping%20in%20plastic%20aluminum,bags%2C%E2%80%9D%20Juarez%20described). Arizona’s detention centers have long histories of abuse allegations, and the worry is that increasing capacity will simply multiply those problems. The coming months will reveal if new oversight mechanisms (like more frequent unannounced inspections by officials – if they can get access) will accompany the growth, or if the “culture of secrecy” persists.

## New Mexico: Reactivating Idle Jails and Resource Strains

In New Mexico, a state with a fraught history with private detention, several facilities are being **quietly reactivated or repurposed** to absorb ICE detainees. This is happening even as state leaders push back and **capacity issues (water, infrastructure)** plague these rural jails.

 

**Torrance County Detention Facility (Estancia, NM):** Torrance is a prime example of _pre-activation signals_ translating into full activation. This CoreCivic-run jail was nearly shut down in 2022 after DHS Inspector General reports of gross neglect (it infamously failed an inspection due to unsafe conditions, prompting ICE to empty it at that time). Fast forward to 2025: under Trump, ICE kept Torrance’s contract alive and began **funneling detainees back in around April**, despite unresolved issues. By June 23, Torrance held an **average of 435 detainees** – a record high since at least 2019[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/2025/07/16/by-the-s-two-nm-jails-house-record-number-of-ice-detainees/#:~:text=On%20June%2023%2C%20the%20most,held%20341%20ICE%20detainees%20there). That number is a 27% increase over last year[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/2025/07/16/by-the-s-two-nm-jails-house-record-number-of-ice-detainees/#:~:text=On%20June%2023%2C%20the%20most,held%20341%20ICE%20detainees%20there). Crucially, this ramp-up occurred amid severe **water system failures**. In late April, the town of Estancia had a municipal water crisis. Torrance’s warden confirmed the jail _“had no water…for three days”_, exhausting backup tanks[heinrich.senate.gov](https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/senator-martin-heinrich-calls-for-torrance-county-ice-detention-facility-to-be-closed#:~:text=question%20about%20the%20broken%20tablets)[heinrich.senate.gov](https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/senator-martin-heinrich-calls-for-torrance-county-ice-detention-facility-to-be-closed#:~:text=TCDF%20Warden%20George%20Dedos%20confirmed,%E2%80%9D). Detainees told Sen. Heinrich’s staff that during the outage they were _only given 2 bottles of drinking water per day, could not flush toilets for days, and got only one hour of running water every third day to shower_[heinrich.senate.gov](https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/senator-martin-heinrich-calls-for-torrance-county-ice-detention-facility-to-be-closed#:~:text=His%20staff%20were%20told%20by,%E2%80%9D). Despite these harrowing accounts, CoreCivic insisted in letters that operations were “not impacted” and that they rationed water responsibly (scheduling showers, trucking in water to flush toilets)[heinrich.senate.gov](https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/senator-martin-heinrich-calls-for-torrance-county-ice-detention-facility-to-be-closed#:~:text=CoreCivic%20was%20notified%20on%20April,our%20care%2C%E2%80%9D%20according%20to%20Todd). The truth likely lies in between, but it is clear normal hygiene and sanitation broke down. Heinrich was so alarmed by what his June 1 oversight visit found – backed-up sewage in drains, broken tablets for legal access, detainee claims of physical abuse – that on June 9 he publicly called for Torrance to be **shut down** entirely[heinrich.senate.gov](https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/senator-martin-heinrich-calls-for-torrance-county-ice-detention-facility-to-be-closed#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFor%20years%2C%20detainees%20have%20been,Lyons%20in%20a%20letter%20Thursday)[heinrich.senate.gov](https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/senator-martin-heinrich-calls-for-torrance-county-ice-detention-facility-to-be-closed#:~:text=Congressional%20staff%20members%20found%20backed,detainees%20and%C2%A0advocates%2C%20the%20letter%20says). ICE has so far ignored those calls, and in fact FOIA-released documents show CoreCivic proactively sought to **renew and expand** its Torrance contract as part of ICE’s nationwide “strategic sourcing” initiative[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/briefs/fate-of-private-new-mexico-prison-unclear-as-ice-detention-ramps-up/#:~:text=ACLU%20filed%20the%20FOIA%20request,County%20Detention%20Facility%20in%20Estancia). The local county commission, which financially benefits from the IGSA, has been largely silent or defensive (they held an _“emergency meeting”_ about Estancia’s water, but not about detainee welfare per se[innovationlawlab.org](https://innovationlawlab.org/torrance-county-detention-facility-timeline/#:~:text=Torrance%20County%20Detention%20Facility%20Timeline,going%20three%20days%20without)). One _red flag_ is that ICE continues adding detainees even as basic services lag – raising the specter of a major health or safety incident if this trajectory continues. Torrance’s situation exemplifies where **federal authority bypasses local capacity limits** – had this been a state-regulated facility, the water outage alone might have triggered an evacuation, but under ICE no such relief came.

 

**Cibola County Correctional Center (Milan, NM):** Another once-mothballed site, Cibola is back in play. This prison (also CoreCivic-run) lost its Bureau of Prisons contract in 2016, then was used by ICE in 2017–2020 (notoriously as the only unit for transgender women, until multiple deaths and scandals led ICE to pull out). For a couple years, Cibola sat mostly empty. Now, data show ICE has been steadily filling it again: **227 detainees on average** by June 23[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/2025/07/16/by-the-s-two-nm-jails-house-record-number-of-ice-detainees/#:~:text=average%20of%20435%20detainees%20at,held%20341%20ICE%20detainees%20there) – the highest since ICE’s 2019 peak – up from 180 a year prior[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/2025/07/16/by-the-s-two-nm-jails-house-record-number-of-ice-detainees/#:~:text=average%20of%20435%20detainees%20at,held%20341%20ICE%20detainees%20there). The new detainee population is reportedly men in removal proceedings (no return of the prior trans unit). The **reactivation flew under the radar**; there were no press releases, just a quiet contract modification. According to FOIA revelations, CoreCivic responded to ICE’s 2024 Request for Information by pitching Cibola as ready for renewed use[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=GEO%2C%20CoreCivic%2C%20and%20MTC%20also,current%20ICE%20detention%20facilities%2C%20including), and ICE has indeed extended that IGSA. The local community of Grants, NM had mixed feelings – some welcome the 300 jobs, others recall the bad publicity from prior abuses. In the 2025 state legislative session, a bill (House Bill 9) proposed to prohibit local governments from contracting with ICE for detention[stateline.org](https://stateline.org/2025/04/11/for-profit-immigration-detention-expands-as-trump-accelerates-his-deportation-plans/#:~:text=New%20Mexico%20legislators%20earlier%20this,agreements%20end%20as%20soon%20as), which would affect Cibola, Otero, and Torrance. That bill did not pass, meaning counties like Cibola remain free to collaborate with ICE. **Local oversight is minimal**: Cibola County’s role is largely to act as a passthrough for payments. There’s evidence of problems continuing: in May, a Cibola guard was caught smuggling drugs for inmates[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/2025/07/16/by-the-s-two-nm-jails-house-record-number-of-ice-detainees/#:~:text=In%20Torrance%20County%20in%20early,smuggle%20drugs%20into%20the%20jail), and advocates note substandard medical care persists (one recent lawsuit alleges a detainee was denied cancer treatment in a timely manner). Without independent monitors, these issues only surface through FOIAs or legal actions. As capacity expands (Cibola could hold over 800 if fully reopened), such discrepancies between ICE’s rosy assessments and on-the-ground conditions are likely to widen.

 

**Lea County (Hobbs) – Conversion in Progress:** A notable development in NM is the attempt to **convert a closing state prison into an ICE detention center**. The Lea County Correctional Facility, a 1,200-bed prison in Hobbs, is owned by GEO Group. The state of NM decided in May to end its contract and transfer out all inmates by **June 30, 2025**[koat.com](https://www.koat.com/article/lea-county-correctional-facility-to-close-after-27-years/64843245#:~:text=KOAT%20www,Facility%20by%20June%2030%2C%202025), part of a move away from private prisons. GEO Group signaled to local officials that it was in talks with the feds: in a May 8 county meeting, the Lea County Attorney said GEO had “spoken with the federal government” about using the prison for immigration detention[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/briefs/fate-of-private-new-mexico-prison-unclear-as-ice-detention-ramps-up/#:~:text=As%20to%20whether%20anyone%20else,%E2%80%9D). In fact, an ICE planning document (obtained by ACLU) listed **Lea County as ‘available for ICE use’** in response to a nationwide capacity query[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/briefs/fate-of-private-new-mexico-prison-unclear-as-ice-detention-ramps-up/#:~:text=GEO%20Group%20mentioned%20the%20Lea,Freedom%20of%20Information%20Act%20request). This is a classic _pre-activation scenario_: a facility is winding down one use and quietly being scoped for another. Lea County and GEO have tried to sell the prison to NM or the county (at prices over $175M) with no takers[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/briefs/fate-of-private-new-mexico-prison-unclear-as-ice-detention-ramps-up/#:~:text=meeting%20on%20Thursday). Absent a sale, GEO likely aims to get an ICE contract and keep the prison running. As of early July, no public contract award has been announced for Hobbs, but observers expect ICE could sign an IGSA with Lea County at any time. If that happens, one might see **job postings for ICE detention officers or medical staff in Hobbs** increase, and construction crews might enter to retrofit the facility (for example, installing immigration court video suites or adding recreation yards to meet ICE standards). Lea County’s leaders appear cautiously optimistic – they haven’t opposed the idea, noting the economic benefit of saving 200 jobs. New Mexico’s congressional delegation, however, is likely skeptical (given Heinrich’s stance on Torrance). A red flag will be **if GEO transfers existing guards from state inmate duty to ICE duty without fresh training**, potentially repeating past mistakes with inadequate preparation for civil detention needs. This situation remains fluid, but it exemplifies how ICE leverages **“warm status” prisons** – facilities recently emptied – to surge capacity with minimal construction.

 

**Doña Ana County and Federal Land Use:** Doña Ana County (which includes Las Cruces and borders Texas) does not currently have an ICE detention center, but it has been floated in various plans. During the Afghan refugee resettlement in 2021, Fort Bliss used its Doña Ana Range Complex (in New Mexico) as a massive temporary camp[theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-army-fort-bliss-deportation-detention#:~:text=Her%20assessment%2C%20she%20said%2C%20was,in%202021%20under%20%2093). Some speculate that area could again host tents or trailers for immigration detention under military auspices, especially given its remote location. Additionally, Doña Ana County’s sheriff in the past cooperated with ICE on holding detainees in the local jail (though as of 2025, that’s limited by state sanctuary policies). The _Immigration Policy Tracking_ records show DHS considered Doña Ana in early discussions for expanding capacity, likely because of its underused federal land. **No concrete moves** have been reported in June–July 2025 specific to Doña Ana facilities for ICE. Nonetheless, we include it as a “watch list” item because any sudden permit filings or lease agreements there (for example, if the county were to lease land to FEMA/ICE for a “processing center”) would be a strong indicator of expansion. Local political posture in Doña Ana leans progressive; county leaders previously objected to cruel detention practices. If the federal government tries to bypass them via the Army base, it could cause friction, but since the base land is federal, local jurisdiction is limited. Essentially, **Doña Ana is a bellwether**: silence means nothing is there yet, but if community activists in Las Cruces start reporting construction equipment heading into the desert range, that would signal a new detention site being born.

 

**Otero County Processing Center (Chaparral, NM):** Although not specifically requested, it’s worth noting Otero as part of the New Mexico cluster. Otero is a long-running ICE detention center (operated by Management & Training Corporation) with ~1,000 bed capacity. It’s currently the largest ICE site in NM, averaging 843 detainees in late June[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/2025/07/16/by-the-s-two-nm-jails-house-record-number-of-ice-detainees/#:~:text=detainees%20in%20custody,ago%2C%20it%20held%20180). Unlike the others, Otero’s population hasn’t exceeded past peaks (it’s now just reaching late-2024 levels)[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/2025/07/16/by-the-s-two-nm-jails-house-record-number-of-ice-detainees/#:~:text=The%20Otero%20County%20Processing%20Center,population%20June%2023%20was%20843). However, Otero has been **consistently plagued by reports of abusive conditions** – described by advocates as “infamous” for inadequate medical care and mistreatment[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/2025/07/16/by-the-s-two-nm-jails-house-record-number-of-ice-detainees/#:~:text=,as%20funding%20boost%20supercharges%20ICE). ICE’s new enforcement wave has increased Otero’s intake too, but not as dramatically as Torrance or Cibola, likely because Otero was never emptied. For completeness: New Mexico’s three ICE jails (Cibola, Torrance, Otero) together held ~1,505 people as of June 23[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/2025/07/16/by-the-s-two-nm-jails-house-record-number-of-ice-detainees/#:~:text=average%20of%20435%20detainees%20at,held%20341%20ICE%20detainees%20there)[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/2025/07/16/by-the-s-two-nm-jails-house-record-number-of-ice-detainees/#:~:text=detainees%20in%20custody,ago%2C%20it%20held%20180), roughly triple the number a year prior, reflecting the nationwide trend.

 

In sum, New Mexico is being used as a **relief valve** for ICE’s detention surge – resurrecting old facilities despite local opposition and infrastructure shortfalls. The preparatory signs here included unusual filings like the **ACLU FOIA lawsuit** (which unmasked ICE’s behind-the-scenes negotiations), abrupt corporate announcements of prison closures (which savvy observers connected to potential ICE use), and on-the-ground anomalies such as water trucks and sewage pumping contractors showing up at Torrance (hinting at facility stress). The NM experience also highlights how DHS can leverage federal preemption: even as state officials like Senator Heinrich and advocates demand closures or stronger regulation, ICE can continue operations largely unchecked, aside from the court of public opinion.

## Transportation, Supply Chains, and Contractors

The machinery of expanded detention doesn’t operate in isolation – it relies on a web of supporting logistics and private contractors. From June 10 to July 12, 2025, several trends emerged in these indirect supply chains:

- **ICE Air & Charter Flights:** June saw **record-breaking ICE Air activity**, underscoring pre-activation logistics. A new report by flight-tracker Tom Cartwright documented **1,187 ICE flights in June 2025**, the most since tracking began[migrantinsider.com](https://migrantinsider.com/p/ice-air-deportation-flights-surge#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%94%C2%A0U,mass%20deportation%20in%20September%202021). Of these, **209 were deportation removals** – a 10% jump from May and 54% higher than the prior six-month average[migrantinsider.com](https://migrantinsider.com/p/ice-air-deportation-flights-surge#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%94%C2%A0U,mass%20deportation%20in%20September%202021)[migrantinsider.com](https://migrantinsider.com/p/ice-air-deportation-flights-surge#:~:text=Of%20the%20total%201%2C187%20flights,flights%20from%2030%20in%20May). Importantly, ICE also ran **697 domestic “shuffle” flights** in June (moving detainees between facilities)[migrantinsider.com](https://migrantinsider.com/p/ice-air-deportation-flights-surge#:~:text=Domestic%20%E2%80%98Shuffle%E2%80%99%20Flights%20Reach%20Record,Levels). Many such shuttles reposition migrants from interior cities to border hubs like El Paso, Harlingen, Tucson, and San Diego for final removal. For instance, families arrested in the Midwest might be flown to San Antonio (as on June 6) to be staged at Dilley or Karnes[news4sanantonio.com](https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/video-shows-ice-agents-escorting-families-off-planes-onto-buses-in-san-antonio#:~:text=News%204%20has%20learned%20that,buses%20awaited%20on%20the%20tarmac)[news4sanantonio.com](https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/video-shows-ice-agents-escorting-families-off-planes-onto-buses-in-san-antonio#:~:text=The%20detention%20center%20in%20Dilley%2C,an%20hour%20southeast%20of%20here). The use of **military aircraft** for deportations – once rare – spiked as well: in late June, the Air Force flew multiple planeloads of deportees to Central America[migrantinsider.com](https://migrantinsider.com/p/ice-air-deportation-flights-surge#:~:text=Military%20Deportations%20Surge%20at%20Month%E2%80%99s,End). Seven military-run flights took off on June 29 alone[migrantinsider.com](https://migrantinsider.com/p/ice-air-deportation-flights-surge#:~:text=Military%20aircraft%20were%20used%20for,military%20involvement%20in%20immigration%20enforcement), suggesting DHS may have been rushing to meet end-of-month targets or to demonstrate capability. This military involvement was enabled by Trump’s emergency orders and has the effect of **circumventing some civilian oversight** (e.g., military flight manifests are not public in the way ICE charters might be). An implication for observers is that tracking ICE operations now requires watching military base airfields and charter terminals.
    
- **Contractor Deployments – Base Camps and Modular Housing:** The _pre-activation phase_ saw specialized contractors setting up temporary detention infrastructure. **Deployed Resources, LLC** – profiled by ProPublica as the “tent company” profiteering from Trump’s plans – has been central in Texas and likely Arizona. It operated the El Paso tent site under a Defense Department contract[propublica.org](https://www.propublica.org/article/ice-cancels-contract-immigrant-detention-camp-fort-bliss#:~:text=Since%20mid,an%20ICE%20spokesperson%20told%20ProPublica) and was lined up for Fort Bliss until that contract’s abrupt termination[propublica.org](https://www.propublica.org/article/ice-cancels-contract-immigrant-detention-camp-fort-bliss#:~:text=Then%2C%20on%20April%2013%2C%20the,to%20the%20federal%20contracting%20site). Even after losing the ICE award, Deployed continued involvement at least in an interim role; ICE officials noted that Deployed was _“adding more rigid structures within its tents”_ at the El Paso camp to address safety concerns[propublica.org](https://www.propublica.org/article/ice-cancels-contract-immigrant-detention-camp-fort-bliss#:~:text=Current%20and%20former%20agency%20officials,which%20could%20address%20such%20concerns). This indicates a **rapid retrofit** – possibly installing hard flooring or frame supports inside the soft tents – done in real-time as detainees arrived. Another player, **Active Deployment Systems**, submitted designs to ICE for modular “camp layouts” on open land, including a concept in Harlingen, TX (home to an ICE staging airport)[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=the%20geographic%20boundaries%20of%20the,City%2C%20MO%3B%20and%20in%20Montana). **Target Hospitality** deserves mention as well: not only did it reactivate Dilley’s lodging, but FOIA files show Target proposed use of **temporary buildings at Carrizo Springs, TX**[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=the%20geographic%20boundaries%20of%20the,City%2C%20MO%3B%20and%20in%20Montana) – a site of a former HHS child shelter – as potential ICE detention space. While Carrizo hasn’t been activated for ICE yet, Target’s proposal shows the contractor ecosystem scouting assets nationwide.
    
- **Security, Food, and Medical Service Vendors:** With detention centers expanding, dozens of subcontractors for daily operations have been (or will be) engaged. Some indicators: procurement notices for _“potable water delivery services”_ to remote facilities (ICE posted a contract for water delivery in May 2025[dhs.gov](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/cpo-ice-contract-actions-reduce-spending#:~:text=Attachment%20Ext,01%20MB%2004%2F24%2F2025), likely for outdoor camps in Texas); job ads in places like **Indeed.com** for detention nurses, counselors, and guards in areas near these facilities. For example, within New Mexico, listings for bilingual mental health professionals and medical staff surged in towns near the Cibola and Torrance facilities in June (anecdotally observed by advocacy groups monitoring job boards). **Catering and commissary** contracts are also telling: TRAC data revealed ICE’s average meal costs and a prior GAO report cited how Deployed Resources overcharged for unused meals[texastribune.org](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/11/trump-deportations-deployed-resources-tent-company/#:~:text=Deployed%20has%20continued%20to%20win,government%20watchdogs%20and%20a%20whistleblower). In this period, ICE and vendors insisted all detainees are fed adequately, pushing back on “inadequate food” reports – DHS even issued a July 14 **fact check** press release claiming each detainee gets multiple meals and snacks daily[dhs.gov](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/07/14/fact-check-ice-provides-multiple-meals-day-criminal-illegal-aliens-held-detention#:~:text=FACT%20CHECK%3A%20ICE%20Provides%20Multiple,All), implicitly responding to lawsuits about hunger in facilities. The presence of this DHS fact-check suggests the government is sensitive to the supply chain criticism.
    
- **Charter Bus Companies and Local Transit:** After planes land, charter buses from companies often contracted by ICE (like _Trailways_ or _GEO Transport_) have been active on tarmacs. The June 6 San Antonio video showed unmarked white buses on the airport runway, escorted by DHS agents, ready to take families to detention[news4sanantonio.com](https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/video-shows-ice-agents-escorting-families-off-planes-onto-buses-in-san-antonio#:~:text=Multiple%20rounds%20of%20planes%20arrived,seen%20boarding%20a%20charter%20bus)[news4sanantonio.com](https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/video-shows-ice-agents-escorting-families-off-planes-onto-buses-in-san-antonio#:~:text=We%20have%20not%20been%20told,where%20these%20buses%20are%20headed). Residents in El Paso similarly noted coach buses leaving the Northeast tent camp at odd hours, likely transferring migrants to ICE Air hubs. These transportation contracts are usually not transparent, but their effect is significant: they allow ICE to **shuffle detainees between states quietly**, often overnight, to wherever bed space opens.
    
- **Public/Private Partnerships and Local Governments:** ICE often relies on county or city entities to formalize detention arrangements (through IGSAs). In this period we saw **tacit partnerships** solidify: e.g., the City of Dilley amending its ICE agreement to accommodate family detention again[investors.targethospitality.com](https://investors.targethospitality.com/news/news-details/2025/Target-Hospitality-Announces-5-year-Contract-Award-Reactivating-South-Texas-Assets/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20Dilley%20Contract%20is%20supported,day%27s%20prior%20notice), and Lea County signaling willingness to partner with ICE if asked[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/briefs/fate-of-private-new-mexico-prison-unclear-as-ice-detention-ramps-up/#:~:text=As%20to%20whether%20anyone%20else,%E2%80%9D). On the flip side, in places like Leavenworth, KS (outside our region), a city actively sued to enforce zoning rules on a CoreCivic prison intended for ICE use[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=recently%20issued%20a%20sole%20source,for%20the%20Baldwin%2C%20MI%20facility) – a rare instance of local permit law being used to stall a detention site. No Southwest locality has yet taken such legal action in 2025. However, **New Mexico’s state government** did take steps (closing a prison, considering a private detention ban) that indirectly pressure ICE’s plans. ICE’s response, as evidenced by FOIA docs, was to note “potentially problematic” state laws and seek ways around them[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=Sabot%20Consulting%20also%20submitted%20a,TX%2C%20previously%20used%20to%20hold)[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=and%20Wyoming,also%20submitted%20a%20proposal%20including) (e.g., Sabot Consulting’s proposal on Utah acknowledged needing a state contract to bypass a ban). In the Southwest context, if a city council suddenly discusses “economic revitalization” via a federal center, that’s often code for an ICE deal. We have not seen explicit council votes from June–July (likely because deals were already inked behind closed doors or at higher levels), but one should monitor meeting agendas in small towns like Estancia or Hobbs for any belated approvals or federal grant mentions.
    

Overall, the supporting supply chain activity confirms a **wide-ranging mobilization**. From the macro level (billions budgeted, flights launched) to the micro (water delivered, toilets rented, guards hired), all signs point to a deliberate build-up for a sustained increase in detention and deportations. It’s the _early stage_ of Trump’s promised deportation push, and as such, some rough edges (contract snafus, resource shortfalls) are apparent. The government appears to be in a hurry – which means some normal processes (competitive bidding, environmental reviews, community consultation) are being sidestepped. For instance, ICE’s _“strategic sourcing”_ bid in early June sought proposals en masse for detention capacity and services[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=misconduct%20and%20abuse%20%E2%80%93%20which,immigration%20detention%20and%20related%20services)[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=expand%20immigrant%20detention,immigration%20detention%20and%20related%20services), essentially a call for any and all vendors to get on board quickly. This rush creates vulnerabilities: companies with checkered histories (like those mentioned above) are getting huge assignments, and oversight might be an afterthought.

## Barriers & Limitations in Research and Oversight

Investigating these developments between June 10 and July 12, 2025, revealed several **barriers to information** and transparency – many likely by design:

- **FOIA Redactions and Opaque Contracts:** Crucial details about the expansion are hidden behind redactions in released documents. The ACLU’s FOIA litigation pried loose some data (facility names, capacities)[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=access%20to%20local%20consulates%20and,in%20use%20by%20ICE%2C%20including)[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=,reopen%20the%20Dilley%2C%20TX%20facility), but ICE heavily redacted sections on _“availability of medical care, pricing, and potential staffing challenges,”_ as well as anything noting _“political opposition”_ or community pushback in the areas under consideration[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=lawsuit%20sought%20records%20related%20to,obtained%20via%20the%20ACLU%E2%80%99s%20litigation). This means the public and watchdogs cannot easily discern which subcontractors are lined up to provide medical services, or how ICE assessed local resistance. For example, if a county was known to oppose an ICE jail, that fact was scrubbed from the docs. This deliberate omission hampers stakeholders trying to hold ICE or local officials accountable.
    
- **Local Public Records – Sparse or Nonexistent:** One might expect to find building permit filings, zoning hearings, or council resolutions when a detention site is built or expanded. In these cases, **federal actions bypassed many local processes**. At Fort Bliss, being on a military base meant no city permit was needed, no zoning change, and even the normally required environmental assessments could be skirted under emergency declarations. Similarly, expansions at private prisons via IGSAs often don’t trigger new local votes because the original contracts are still in force. We attempted to check county permit databases (e.g., El Paso County, Pinal County for Eloy) – no new construction permits were on file for the ICE facilities during this period. This indicates that either work was done under existing permits or classified as “maintenance,” or simply that no meaningful physical construction (beyond tents) required permits. **Bottom line:** traditional paper trails were minimal, so one must rely on eyewitness accounts and media reports.
    
- **Press Silence and Reliance on Advocates:** In some localities, there’s a notable silence from local press about detention developments. For instance, in Dilley and Karnes City, the local newspapers and city websites had virtually no mention of the family facilities reopening – the news came via a corporate press release and national outlets. This could be due to small-town media scarcity or a reluctance to shine a light on a contentious employer. In New Mexico, by contrast, outlets like _Source NM_ and _NM Political Report_ have been covering these issues, but they face resource constraints and often the story is framed as part of national policy (which can make it less tangible for local audiences). There have also been accusations (from activists) that some city and county officials actively _withhold information_. For example, lawyers in New Mexico reported difficulty obtaining up-to-date detainee counts from county detention administrators – TRAC’s data had to fill that gap[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/2025/07/16/by-the-s-two-nm-jails-house-record-number-of-ice-detainees/#:~:text=The%20trend%20is%20reflected%20in,has%20steadily%20increased%20since%20April)[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/2025/07/16/by-the-s-two-nm-jails-house-record-number-of-ice-detainees/#:~:text=In%20two%20of%20three%20New,since%20this%20time%20last%20year). Furthermore, ICE has not been forthcoming: multiple press inquiries (including our own) to ICE Public Affairs during this period went unanswered or yielded boilerplate statements. This suggests a culture of secrecy is prevailing as these projects ramp up.
    
- **Suppression of Oversight and Detainee Voices:** A striking barrier is the **impediment to independent oversight**. As noted, ICE’s new protocol asking Congress members to give 72-hour notice[elpasomatters.org](https://elpasomatters.org/2025/06/24/ice-detention-facility-el-paso/#:~:text=Escobar%20said%20she%20didn%E2%80%99t%20have,ICE%20ahead%20of%20her%20visit) effectively thwarts spontaneous inspections that might catch problems in real time. The incident with Rep. LaMonica McIver in May (charged after pressing to access a facility) sent a chilling message to other officials[heinrich.senate.gov](https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/senator-martin-heinrich-calls-for-torrance-county-ice-detention-facility-to-be-closed#:~:text=As%20the%20Trump%20administration%20has,to%20arrest%20the%20Newark%20mayor). Additionally, detainees inside facilities often rely on phones or tablets to report conditions – yet Heinrich’s staff found **“non-functioning tablets”** at Torrance[heinrich.senate.gov](https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/newsroom/in-the-news/senator-martin-heinrich-calls-for-torrance-county-ice-detention-facility-to-be-closed#:~:text=Congressional%20staff%20members%20found%20backed,detainees%20and%C2%A0advocates%2C%20the%20letter%20says), cutting off a lifeline to legal help. Some lawyers have claimed that facility wardens are denying or delaying legal visitation under various pretexts as raids and transfers intensify (though specific evidence of this in June was mostly anecdotal). On the community side, protests have been relatively small and contained (e.g., the Eloy protest had dozens, not hundreds, of participants[azfamily.com](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/06/25/groups-protest-outside-eloy-detention-center-against-immigration-arrests/#:~:text=Share%20on%20LinkedIn)). While there haven’t been blatant crackdowns on protests, the remote location of many detention sites and the quick turnaround from planning to execution means local residents often **learn of a detention expansion only after it’s a fait accompli**.
    
- **Emergency Powers and Legal Waivers:** DHS and ICE are leveraging emergency powers that allow them to bypass typical procurement rules and local consultation. The Fort Bliss camp, for instance, was initially paid for by DOD funds under a border emergency declaration[texastribune.org](https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/11/trump-deportations-deployed-resources-tent-company/#:~:text=use%20one%20of%20those%20border,by%20Immigration%20and%20Customs%20Enforcement), avoiding the open procurement process until after the fact. When ICE did attempt a normal contract (with Deployed Resources), political blowback (possibly from transparency or bid complaints) led them to cancel and regroup[propublica.org](https://www.propublica.org/article/ice-cancels-contract-immigrant-detention-camp-fort-bliss#:~:text=Then%2C%20on%20April%2013%2C%20the,to%20the%20federal%20contracting%20site)[propublica.org](https://www.propublica.org/article/ice-cancels-contract-immigrant-detention-camp-fort-bliss#:~:text=In%20solicitation%20documents%2C%20the%20government,immigrants%20before%20they%20are%20deported). This back-and-forth shows ICE is operating in uncharted territory, and it may default to less transparent methods (like interagency agreements or incremental task orders under existing contracts) to get things done quietly. Also notable: **immigration detention standards** can be waived in emergencies – for example, ICE can request exceptions to standards for new “surge” facilities (like not having law library access for detainees for the first 30 days, etc.). Any such waivers are not public unless leaked. This is a limitation in assessing conditions: we might hear that a tent camp has no attorney visitation rooms, but ICE can say it’s within allowed exceptions due to emergency, and the documentation of that is internal.
    
- **Data Gaps (Charter Flight specifics, Vendor identities):** While we have macro data on flights, specifics like **which airlines or companies** are ferrying detainees are hard to pin down in real time. Some observers noted iAero Airways and World Atlantic Airlines jets at San Antonio and Tucson – common ICE charter contractors – but flight manifests aren’t published. Similarly, vendor contracts for services like meals and healthcare are often subcontracts under the facility operators (e.g., CoreCivic might subcontract to Trinity Services for food). Those details are buried in corporate disclosures or local health inspection reports, which lag. We looked for health inspection reports for kitchens at these facilities; Torrance, for example, had a scathing report in 2022 for kitchen mold, but no new report yet in 2025 despite the kitchen being reactivated. Lack of up-to-date third-party inspections is a limitation.
    

**Inaccessible Records and Delayed Filings:** Some public records that do exist are significantly delayed. For instance, SAM.gov (the federal procurement site) showed a _Justification and Approval_ for a California facility sole-source in mid-April[aclu.org](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-foia-litigation-reveals-information-about-plans-to-expand-ice-detention-facilities-nationwide#:~:text=,GEO%20recently), but the one for Fort Bliss or others in our region might not be posted for weeks or months due to classification or delays in writing. State workforce notices about large hiring or layoffs can also tip off activity – we saw one: GEO’s WARN notice for 203 layoffs at Lea County when the prison contract ended[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/briefs/fate-of-private-new-mexico-prison-unclear-as-ice-detention-ramps-up/#:~:text=said). But in cases where staff are simply repurposed (no net layoffs or hires above reporting thresholds), the public won’t see a WARN notice. We tried obtaining **water usage records** for Estancia to quantify Torrance’s water outage impact; those records require formal requests and were not available in time, though an emergency town meeting confirmed the outage broadly[sourcenm.com](https://sourcenm.com/2025/07/16/by-the-s-two-nm-jails-house-record-number-of-ice-detainees/#:~:text=On%20June%2023%2C%20the%20most,County%20Detention%20Center%20in).

 

In summary, uncovering pre-activation detention operations required piecing together fragmented sources – investigative news reports, FOIA disclosures, local meeting minutes, and even social media – because official channels are often **one step behind** or intentionally obscure. This scattershot documentation is itself a red flag: it suggests ICE and its partners know these expansions are controversial and are trying to stay _below the radar_ as long as possible. Persistent public records requests and on-the-ground observation (e.g., watching who moves into a shuttered prison, tracking unusual utility work at facilities) will be critical to continue monitoring these developments. Each gap in information underscores the need for vigilance: as one advocate aptly put it, _“We often only find out about a new ICE jail after people are already locked inside”_. Our research strives to close that gap by highlighting the early warning signs before facilities reach that point.
